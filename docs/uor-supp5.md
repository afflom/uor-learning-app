# Coherence Geometry, Symmetry, and Stratified Moduli in the Prime UOR Framework

*In this supplement, we develop rigorous mathematical structures latent in the Universal Object Reference (UOR) Prime Framework. Building on the established notions of unique factorization and prime coordinates, we formalize new concepts including a geometry of **coherence** (via an observer bundle and associated invariants), a stratification of object space by prime support, internal symmetry groups of factorizations, and a sheaf-theoretic perspective that couples objects with observers. All aspects are presented with precise definitions, propositions, and proofs, emphasizing internal consistency and mathematical completeness.* 

## Intrinsic Prime Coordinates and the Coherence Norm

We begin by recalling the core assumption of the Prime Framework: that every object in the universe $\mathcal{U}$ decomposes uniquely into irreducible **prime** components. This can be formalized as a unique factorization axiom:

\begin{axiom}[Unique Prime Factorization of Objects]\label{ax:UFD} 
There is a distinguished set $P_{\mathcal{U}}$ of **intrinsic primes** (indecomposable objects) in $\mathcal{U}$, such that every object $X\in\mathcal{U}$ can be expressed as 
\[ 
X \;\cong\; p_1 \circ p_2 \circ \cdots \circ p_k, 
\] 
a combination (product) of finitely many primes $p_i \in P_{\mathcal{U}}$. Moreover, this factorization is **unique up to order**: if $X \cong q_1 \circ \cdots \circ q_m$ is another such decomposition, then $m=k$ and there is a permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,\dots,k\}$ with $q_i \cong p_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i$. (Here $\circ$ denotes the appropriate composition operation in $\mathcal{U}$, such as multiplication in a numeric domain.)
\end{axiom}

Given this axiom, one can define a canonical coordinate representation for each object. Intuitively, we assign to $X$ an **exponent vector** indexed by all primes, where the component for prime $p$ records how many times $p$ appears in $X$’s factorization. Formally:

\begin{definition}[UOR Prime Coordinate Map]\label{def:UORcoordinate}
Let $\mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})}$ denote the free abelian group of finitely supported integer sequences over $P_{\mathcal{U}}$. Define the **prime coordinate map** 
\[ 
\Phi: \mathcal{U} \;\to\; \mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})} 
\] 
as follows: for each object $X\in\mathcal{U}$ with prime factorization $X \cong \displaystyle\bigcirc_{i=1}^k p_i$ (primes not necessarily distinct if repetition occurs), $\Phi(X)$ is the function $\alpha: P_{\mathcal{U}} \to \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\alpha(p)$ equals the number of times $p$ appears in the decomposition of $X$ (and $\alpha(p)=0$ for primes $p$ not dividing $X$). We write this coordinate as 
\[ 
\Phi(X) = (\alpha(p))_{p\in P_{\mathcal{U}}}, 
\] 
which has finite support by definition. For example, if $X \cong p^a \circ q^b$ (with $p,q$ distinct primes and $a,b>0$ integers), then $\Phi(X)$ has $\Phi(X)(p)=a$, $\Phi(X)(q)=b$, and $\Phi(X)(r)=0$ for any other prime $r$. 
\end{definition}

By Axiom \ref{ax:UFD}, $\Phi(X)$ is well-defined and **unique** for each object $X$. In other words, $\Phi$ is an injective map capturing the “atomic signature” of $X$. It is helpful to think of $\Phi(X)$ as coordinates of $X$ in a high-dimensional space whose axes are the primes. The arithmetic operation on objects translates under $\Phi$ into addition on these exponent vectors (since combining objects by $\circ$ corresponds to summing the counts of each prime). Indeed, if $Y \cong X_1 \circ X_2$ then $\Phi(Y) = \Phi(X_1) + \Phi(X_2)$ (prime counts add).

To rigorously single out the *canonical* representation of each object (fully factored into primes), the framework defines a measure of representational complexity called the **coherence norm**. Intuitively, any departure from the prime factor form (such as grouping primes into composites) should yield a “less coherent” (more complex) description, which the norm quantifies as having larger size. We formalize this as follows:

\begin{definition}[Coherence Norm]\label{def:coherence-norm}
Fix an object $X\in\mathcal{U}$ and let $\Phi(X)=(\alpha(p))_{p\in P_{\mathcal{U}}}$ be its prime exponent vector. The **coherence norm** of $X$, denoted $\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}}$, is defined as an $\ell^2$-length of its exponent vector:
\[ 
\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}} \;=\; \Big(\sum_{p \in P_{\mathcal{U}}} \alpha(p)^2\Big)^{1/2}, 
\] 
where the sum is finite since $\Phi(X)$ has finite support. (One may alternatively use an $\ell^1$ norm $\sum |\alpha(p)|$, or other monotonic measures of the vector’s size; the exact choice is not unique, but any reasonable norm will serve to compare representation sizes.)
\end{definition}

Thus, for an integer-like object $X = p_1^{a_1}\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, we have $\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}} = \sqrt{a_1^2 + \cdots + a_k^2}$. For instance, if $N=12$ in $\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{Z}$, then the prime factorization $12=2^2\cdot 3^1$ yields $\Phi(12)=(2,1,0,0,\dots)$ (with 2 at prime $2$, 1 at prime $3$) and $\|12\|_{\mathrm{coh}}=\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\sqrt{5}$. This norm is smaller than the norm of any “less factored” description of 12. For example, describing 12 as $6\cdot2$ (treating 6 as an atomic component) would correspond to exponents $(0,0,1,0,\dots)$ for prime $6$ and $2$ (in a context where $6$ is artificially considered a single factor): the norm would be $\sqrt{1^2+1^2}=\sqrt{2}$ for that representation’s exponent counts. However, such a representation is not valid in the factorization sense because 6 is not prime; one must further factor 6 into $2\cdot 3$. In essence, $\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}}$ attains its **minimum** when $X$ is fully decomposed into true primes. We state this property generally:

\begin{proposition}[Minimality of Prime Factorization]\label{prop:minimality}
Let $X\in\mathcal{U}$, and suppose $X$ is expressed as a composite of some components $X \cong Y_1 \circ Y_2 \circ \cdots \circ Y_m$. Consider the sum of coherence norms of those components, $\sum_{i=1}^m \|Y_i\|_{\mathrm{coh}}$. This sum is minimized (indeed, uniquely minimized) when each $Y_i$ is an intrinsic prime. In particular, $\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}} \le \sum_{i=1}^m \|Y_i\|_{\mathrm{coh}}$, with equality if and only if each $Y_i$ in the given decomposition is a prime factor of $X$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} 
Because the coherence norm is defined via the squared $\ell^2$ length of the prime exponent vector, it is subject to the **Pythagorean minimization principle**: breaking a vector into two or more nonzero parts will increase the sum of lengths. Concretely, let $\Phi(Y_i) = (\alpha_i(p))_{p\in P_{\mathcal{U}}}$ for each component. Then $\Phi(X) = \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(Y_i)$ (componentwise sum of exponent functions). By the parallelogram law in Euclidean geometry (or simply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we have 
\[ 
\Big\|\sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(Y_i)\Big\|_2 \le \sum_{i=1}^m \|\Phi(Y_i)\|_2, 
\] 
with equality if and only if the support of each $\Phi(Y_i)$ lies in mutually orthogonal directions. Here orthogonality in the exponent space essentially means the $Y_i$ share no prime factors in common. If any $Y_i$ is *composite* (i.e. further divisible into primes), we can write $Y_i = A \circ B$ for some nontrivial factors $A, B$. Then $\Phi(Y_i) = \Phi(A)+\Phi(B)$, and one easily checks that 
\[ \|\Phi(A)+\Phi(B)\|_2 = \sqrt{\|A\|_{\mathrm{coh}}^2 + \|B\|_{\mathrm{coh}}^2 + 2\langle \Phi(A),\Phi(B)\rangle} > \|A\|_{\mathrm{coh}} + \|B\|_{\mathrm{coh}}, \] 
because $\Phi(A),\Phi(B)$ have support on (at least one) common prime or simply because both are in the same quadrant (all exponents nonnegative), making the vector sum strictly longer than the sum of lengths.  Iterating this argument, any representation of $X$ that is not fully prime-factored yields a strictly larger total norm than the true prime factorization. Therefore the unique shortest-description (minimal norm) occurs when each $Y_i$ is irreducible (prime), in which case the inequality collapses to an equality (since distinct prime factors contribute orthogonal unit vectors in the exponent space). 
\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{prop:minimality} ensures that the **canonical coordinate** of $X$ — namely $\Phi(X)$ itself — yields the simplest (most “coherent”) description of $X$ in terms of basic components. In fact, one can interpret $\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}}^2$ as a measure of the complexity or *information content* of object $X$’s structure: it counts the sum of squares of prime counts. A fully prime object (indecomposable) has norm equal to 1 (or to $\sqrt{a^2}$ if it has an exponent $a$ in some context, but usually primes are considered with exponent $1$ when isolated). Any composite object has a larger norm, reflecting the presence of multiple independent pieces.

Finally, equipping the exponent space with this norm gives it the structure of a Euclidean vector space. We define an inner product on $\mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})}$ such that the prime coordinate axes are orthonormal:

\begin{definition}[Coherence Inner Product]\label{def:coherence-metric}
For exponent vectors $v=(\alpha(p))_{p\in P_{\mathcal{U}}}$ and $w=(\beta(p))_{p\in P_{\mathcal{U}}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})}$, define 
\[ 
\langle v, w \rangle_{\mathrm{coh}} \;=\; \sum_{p\in P_{\mathcal{U}}} \alpha(p)\,\beta(p). 
\] 
The associated metric tensor (the identity in these coordinates) is called the **coherence metric** $g_{\mathrm{coh}}$, and $\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}} = \sqrt{\langle \Phi(X), \Phi(X)\rangle_{\mathrm{coh}}}$ as above.
\end{definition}

This simple Euclidean structure $g_{\mathrm{coh}}$ on the coordinate space will be useful when we discuss geometric aspects of coherence. We note that $g_{\mathrm{coh}}$ treats each prime dimension uniformly; domain-specific refinements could weight different primes differently, but absent additional data, symmetry suggests treating all irreducibles equivalently. With these preliminaries in hand, we now turn to the integration of **observers** (reference frames) and the geometry of coherence in the UOR framework.

## Coherence Geometry: Observer Bundles and Frame Invariance

A distinctive aspect of the Prime Framework is its inclusion of an **observer** or reference frame as a fundamental component in describing any object. Rather than viewing the observer as an external or philosophical notion, the framework formalizes it as a mathematical degree of freedom attached to each object. The rationale is captured by the **Trilateral Coherence Axiom**, which posits that to fully specify an entity, one must account for three interlocking facets: its structure, its dynamics, and the observer’s perspective. We formalize this axiom and then develop the notion of an **observer bundle** to encapsulate all possible frames of reference.

\begin{axiom}[Trilateral Coherence: Structure–Dynamics–Observer]\label{ax:trilateral}
Every object $X\in \mathcal{U}$ is characterized not only by an intrinsic structure (e.g. its prime coordinates $\Phi(X)$) and by the transformations or dynamics it can undergo, but also by the reference frame or observer context from which it is described. We require that these three aspects — **Structure** ($S$), **Dynamics** ($D$), and **Observer** ($O$) — are present and **coherent** in any valid description of $X$. Coherence here means consistency and invariance: if $(S, D, O)$ and $(S', D', O')$ are two descriptions of the same underlying object/state, then they must be related by a well-defined transformation that respects each component (e.g. a change of observer $O\to O'$ induces corresponding changes $S\to S'$, $D\to D'$ so that no intrinsic information is lost or contradicted). Any description that omits or inconsistently mixes these aspects is not permissible in the framework.
\end{axiom}

In practice, Axiom \ref{ax:trilateral} enforces that one cannot arbitrarily change the reference frame or viewpoint without adjusting the structural description and dynamic context in a mathematically lawful way. It elevates the observer to a formal element: for each object $X$, we consider pairs $(X, r)$ where $r$ is an **observer state** or frame from some space $R$ of all possible reference frames. We can think of $R$ abstractly as the set of all admissible coordinate gauges or observational perspectives. The collection of all such pairs forms a fiber bundle:

\begin{definition}[Observer Fiber Bundle]\label{def:observer-bundle}
Define the **observer bundle** $\pi: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{U}$ by $\mathcal{E} = \{(X,r) : X\in \mathcal{U},\; r \in R\}$ and $\pi(X,r)=X$. Here $R$ is the **fiber** representing the set of all reference frames (assumed to be a fixed set or manifold of frame parameters). For a given object $X$, the fiber $\pi^{-1}(X) = \{X\}\times R$ is the set of all pairs $(X,r)$, i.e. all ways to equip $X$ with a choice of observer/frame. Local trivializations of this bundle correspond to choosing a “standard frame” in a region of $\mathcal{U}$, i.e. selecting a continuous section $X \mapsto (X, r_X)$ for $X$ in some subset of $\mathcal{U}$.
\end{definition}

In less formal terms, $\mathcal{E}$ attaches to each object a copy of $R$. We may view an element $r\in R$ as an **observer reference** (this could encode coordinate orientation, units, or any context that an observer might fix when describing $X$). The critical requirement of the framework is that changing $r$ while keeping $X$ fixed **must not change the intrinsic prime coordinates $\Phi(X)$**. In other words, the prime factorization is an invariant across all reference frames. This idea can be stated as a consistency condition on the bundle:

\begin{proposition}[Frame Invariance of Intrinsic Coordinates]\label{prop:invariance}
The prime coordinate map $\Phi: \mathcal{U}\to \mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})}$ lifts to a well-defined map on the observer bundle that is independent of the frame. Specifically, there exists a map $\widetilde{\Phi}: \mathcal{E} \to \mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})}$ such that $\widetilde{\Phi}(X,r) = \Phi(X)$ for all $(X,r)\in \mathcal{E}$. Equivalently, for every object $X$ and any two frames $r, r' \in R$, 
\[ \widetilde{\Phi}(X,r) = \widetilde{\Phi}(X,r') \]
(which just says $\Phi(X)$ is single-valued, independent of $r$). This condition implies that the observer bundle has zero intrinsic curvature with respect to changes in $\Phi$ (in a sense made precise below).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Definition \ref{def:observer-bundle}, $\pi:\mathcal{E}\to \mathcal{U}$ is just a projection, so any function on $\mathcal{U}$ can be composed with $\pi$ to yield a function on $\mathcal{E}$. Define $\widetilde{\Phi} = \Phi \circ \pi$. Then for any $(X,r)\in \mathcal{E}$, $\widetilde{\Phi}(X,r) = \Phi(\pi(X,r)) = \Phi(X)$. This shows $\widetilde{\Phi}$ is well-defined and constant on each fiber $\{X\}\times R$. In particular $\widetilde{\Phi}(X,r) = \widetilde{\Phi}(X,r')$ for any $r,r'$. This is exactly the statement that prime coordinates are invariant under frame changes. The term “zero curvature” alludes to the fact that if we consider transporting an object’s description around a loop in the space of frames, we return to the same intrinsic coordinates — there is no holonomy picking up a discrepancy.
\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{prop:invariance} establishes that the prime factorization is an **absolute invariant**: it does not depend on who observes the object or how it is observed. This might seem obvious given unique factorization, but it has nontrivial implications. In geometric terms, it indicates that the observer bundle $\mathcal{E}$ is **fiberwise trivial** with respect to the intrinsic data $\Phi(X)$: one can project down from $(X,r)$ to $X$ and then to $\Phi(X)$ without ambiguity. Any two observers will agree on the “prime content” of $X$. 

However, observers can differ in other ways — for example, in how they parameterize transformations or dynamics of $X$, or how they label composite groupings if they choose not to fully factor (though any such choice ultimately must refine to the same primes). To capture how an observer change might *transform* a description without altering $\Phi(X)$, we consider the notion of **frame transformations**. Mathematically, these are the transition functions of the bundle:

If $r, r' \in R$ are two frames, moving from $(X,r)$ to $(X,r')$ along the fiber entails a frame transformation $\tau_{r\to r'}$ that should act on any extended structure apart from $\Phi(X)$. For instance, $\tau_{r\to r'}$ might relabel coordinates or transform dynamic variables. We formalize the collection of all frame transformations as an **observer group** $G$ acting on the bundle $\mathcal{E}$. Typically, we assume $R$ has the structure of a homogeneous space of $G$ (often $R$ can be identified with $G$ itself, or $G$ acts transitively on $R$). In many cases, $G$ will be isomorphic to a symmetry group of the coordinate system (for example, permuting basis axes, scaling units, etc.). For our purposes, it suffices to treat frame changes as invertible maps $(X,r)\mapsto (X,r')$ that preserve $X$ and hence preserve $\Phi(X)$.

We now introduce a key geometric notion: the possibility that successive frame changes do not commute. While $\Phi(X)$ remains fixed, the *order* in which one changes observer perspective could, in principle, matter for other contextual details. If $\tau_{r\to r'}$ and $\tau_{r'\to r''}$ do not compose to the same result as $\tau_{r\to r''}$ directly, the bundle exhibits a nontrivial **curvature** or holonomy. In the UOR framework’s idealized form, we **require** that descriptions are invariant under such loops (to avoid introducing arbitrary observer-dependent effects). Formally:

\begin{definition}[Coherence Curvature]\label{def:curvature}
Consider the observer bundle $\mathcal{E}$ with structure group $G$ of frame transformations. A loop in the fiber direction is a sequence $(X,r) \to (X,r') \to (X,r)$ which returns to the same object and same starting frame in $\mathcal{E}$ after two frame changes. The **coherence curvature** is the failure of frame transformations to commute, measured by the group commutator or holonomy around loops. Specifically, if $\tau_{r\to r'}\in G$ and $\tau_{r'\to r''}\in G$ are frame changes, the composed change $(X,r) \to (X,r'')$ can be reached by two paths: directly via $\tau_{r\to r''}$, or via $\tau_{r'\to r''}\circ \tau_{r\to r'}$. The curvature is nonzero if 
\[ 
\tau_{r'\to r''} \circ \tau_{r\to r'} \;\neq\; \tau_{r\to r''} 
\] 
for some triple of frames $r, r', r''$. Equivalently, there is a nontrivial commutator $[\tau_{r\to r'}, \tau_{r'\to r''}] \neq e$ in $G$. If the curvature is zero, all frame changes commute (the bundle is flat), and moving around any closed loop in frame space yields no change: $\tau_{r\to r} = e$.
\end{definition}

In physical analogies, a nonzero curvature in an observer bundle would mean that shifting perspectives in different ways could lead to different internal states — a problematic observer-dependence. UOR’s **coherence** principle demands that such effects be absent for intrinsic structure: as shown, $\Phi(X)$ is invariant, so any holonomy must act trivially on $\Phi(X)$. Indeed, since $\Phi(X)$ does not change at all with $r$, the effective curvature seen by $\Phi$ is zero. We can say:

\begin{theorem}[Flatness of the Intrinsic Observer Bundle]\label{thm:flatness}
Under Axiom \ref{ax:trilateral} and the invariance condition of Proposition \ref{prop:invariance}, the observer bundle $\mathcal{E}$ is **flat with respect to intrinsic data**. There exists a global cross-section $\sigma: \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{E}$ (the choice of the canonical prime frame for each object) such that $\widetilde{\Phi}\circ \sigma = \Phi$. Consequently, the holonomy group acting on the intrinsic coordinates is trivial. Any curvature in $\mathcal{E}$ lies entirely in the “redundant” directions that do not affect prime coordinates.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The map $\sigma: X \mapsto (X, r_0)$, where $r_0$ is some fixed **canonical frame**, is a section of $\pi$ over all of $\mathcal{U}$ provided we can choose such an $r_0$ uniformly. In many settings, one can designate a distinguished observer (for example, an “intrinsic” or neutral frame) that applies to all objects. If such a uniform choice is not available globally, one can still locally trivialize the bundle (by choosing a frame in a neighborhood of objects) because $\mathcal{U}$ can be covered by trivializing patches due to Proposition \ref{prop:invariance} (which ensures consistency on overlaps). In either case, one obtains at least locally a section $\sigma$ satisfying $\pi\circ\sigma = \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{U}}$. Now, $\widetilde{\Phi}(\sigma(X)) = \widetilde{\Phi}(X, r_0) = \Phi(X)$ for all $X$. This shows that the prime coordinates can be obtained by observing each object in the canonical frame $r_0$. Since $\Phi(X)$ is independent of the path (choice of frames) taken, any loop of frame changes yields no change in $\Phi(X)$; the bundle’s structure group $G$ thereby has no effect on $\Phi$. We conclude that the parallel transport of intrinsic coordinates is path-independent, which is the definition of flatness (zero curvature) in this context. $\square$
\end{proof}

Theorem \ref{thm:flatness} underscores a crucial point: **despite incorporating observers, the framework maintains objectivity of intrinsic structure.** One can consistently “factor out” the observer influence to recover a description on which all agree (namely, the prime factorization). Any remaining freedom in changing frames corresponds to symmetries or redundancies that do not alter the core representation. In category-theoretic language, the observer perspectives form a group of **auto-equivalences** on the category of objects that act trivially on the isomorphism-invariant data $\Phi(X)$. We could describe the situation by saying the functor $\Phi: \mathcal{U}\to \text{Vect}$ (to the vector space of exponents) factors through the quotient of the category of $\mathcal{E}$ by the action of $R$. More concretely, if we think of $\mathcal{E}$ as a **sheaf of frames** over $\mathcal{U}$, this sheaf has a global section selecting the prime-coordinate frame. We will revisit this sheaf perspective after examining another latent structure: the stratification of object space by prime content and the internal symmetries it reveals.

## Prime-Stratified Moduli and Internal Symmetry

The prime coordinate map $\Phi$ embeds objects of $\mathcal{U}$ into an abstract high-dimensional space $\mathbb{Z}^{(P_{\mathcal{U}})}$. We may think of the collection of all such coordinates (the image of $\Phi$) as a kind of **moduli space of objects**, parameterized by prime exponents. A rich combinatorial structure emerges when we consider how this space is organized according to which primes are present or absent in a given object. This leads to a natural **stratification** of $\mathcal{U}$ by prime support, as well as insight into **internal symmetry groups** of objects that have repeated prime factors.

\begin{definition}[Prime Support and Stratification]\label{def: stratification}
For an object $X\in\mathcal{U}$, define the **prime support** of $X$ as 
\[ 
\mathrm{Supp}(X) \;=\; \{\, p \in P_{\mathcal{U}} \;:\; \Phi(X)(p) \neq 0 \,\}, 
\] 
the set of all primes that appear with nonzero exponent in $X$’s factorization. For each finite subset $S \subseteq P_{\mathcal{U}}$, let 
\[ 
\mathcal{U}_S \;=\; \{\, X \in \mathcal{U} : \mathrm{Supp}(X) = S \,\}, 
\] 
the set of objects whose prime support is exactly $S$. We call $\mathcal{U}_S$ a **support stratum** of the object space. By convention, $\mathcal{U}_\emptyset$ contains the unit object (which has no prime factors, e.g. the number $1$ if $\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{Z}$). The collection of all such strata $\{\mathcal{U}_S: S\subset P_{\mathcal{U}}, |S|<\infty\}$ partitions $\mathcal{U}$: indeed, every object falls into exactly one stratum corresponding to its set of prime divisors.
\end{definition}

We have $\mathcal{U} = \bigsqcup_{S \subset P_{\mathcal{U}}} \mathcal{U}_S$ as a disjoint union. Each stratum $\mathcal{U}_S$ can be understood as those objects composed precisely of the primes in $S$ (each possibly raised to some power $\ge 1$). Through the coordinate map $\Phi$, we can identify $\mathcal{U}_S$ with the lattice of exponent vectors supported on $S$:

\begin{proposition}[Coordinate Description of Strata]\label{prop:strata-coordinates}
For a finite set $S=\{p_{1},\dots,p_{n}\}\subset P_{\mathcal{U}}$, the coordinate map $\Phi$ induces a bijection 
\[ 
\Phi: \mathcal{U}_S \;\xrightarrow{\;\cong\;}\; \{\, (\alpha(p))_{p\in S} \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}^{\,n} : \alpha(p_i)\ge 1 \text{ for }p_i\in S \,\}, 
\] 
i.e. $\mathcal{U}_S$ corresponds to the set of $n$-tuples of positive integers giving the exponents for the primes in $S$. If we allow exponent $0$ as well (e.g. including boundary cases where a prime’s exponent could tend to zero), then the closure $\overline{\mathcal{U}_S}$ in a topological sense would include lower-dimensional strata $\mathcal{U}_T$ for $T\subset S$. In this way, the collection of all $\mathcal{U}_S$ forms a stratification analogous to a coordinate hyperplane arrangement.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By definition of $\mathcal{U}_S$, any $X\in \mathcal{U}_S$ has $\Phi(X)$ supported on $S$ and with each $\alpha(p)>0$ for $p\in S$ (since $p\in \mathrm{Supp}(X)$ implies at least one of that prime). Conversely, any choice of positive integers $\{\alpha(p_i): p_i\in S\}$ yields an object $X \cong \prod_{p_i\in S} p_i^{\alpha(p_i)} \in \mathcal{U}_S$ by assembling those primes with the given exponents. The uniqueness of factorization ensures this correspondence is one-to-one. Thus $\Phi$ restricted to $\mathcal{U}_S$ gives an isomorphism onto $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}^n$ (which is essentially the lattice of points in the positive orthant of $\mathbb{R}^n$). If one adjoins points where some $\alpha(p)=0$, those points correspond to objects in a stratum where that prime is absent (i.e. if $\alpha(p_j)=0$, then the object actually lies in $\mathcal{U}_{S\setminus\{p_j\}}$). In a topological or closure sense, one can include those as boundary points, but strictly $\mathcal{U}_S$ as defined requires all exponents $>0$. The union of all such $\Phi(\mathcal{U}_S)$ for varying $S$ is exactly the set of all finitely-supported exponent vectors, reproducing $\Phi(\mathcal{U})$.
\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{prop:strata-coordinates} allows us to view the space of objects $\mathcal{U}$ (or rather its image under $\Phi$) as a **union of orthants** in an infinite-dimensional space. Each stratum $\mathcal{U}_S$ is like an $n$-dimensional positive quadrant (where $n=|S|$). These strata meet at lower-dimensional faces corresponding to when one or more primes have exponent $0$ (i.e. when one transitions to a subset of $S$). The poset of strata by inclusion of $S$ is precisely the Boolean lattice of finite subsets of $P_{\mathcal{U}}$. In more algebraic terms, one can regard this stratification as analogous to the decomposition of an algebraic variety into pieces defined by the vanishing or nonvanishing of certain coordinates. Here, “$p\in \mathrm{Supp}(X)$” is analogous to “coordinate $x_p \neq 0$”.

An immediate observation is that each stratum $\mathcal{U}_S$ is, up to the discrete lattice structure of exponents, an **$|S|$-parameter family** of objects. If we allowed continuous exponents (say objects could be fractional powers or measures), $\mathcal{U}_S$ would become a continuous $|S|$-dimensional manifold (or algebraic variety isomorphic to $(\mathbb{C}^*)^{|S|}$ if complexified). Even within the integer paradigm, treating exponents as variables suggests viewing $\mathcal{U}_S$ as $\prod_{p\in S} p^{\mathbb{N}}$, reminiscent of a torus or affine subspace in log-coordinates.

Now, within each stratum $\mathcal{U}_S$, consider an object $X$ and its prime factorization $X=\prod_{p\in S} p^{\alpha(p)}$. If some primes appear with exponents greater than 1, one might ask: does $X$ have any **symmetries** related to these identical factors? In the pure numeric context, permuting identical prime factors has no effect (they are truly identical and multiplication is commutative). However, more generally, if an object has multiple **indistinguishable components**, there is an internal permutation symmetry. We formalize the notion of an object’s **internal symmetry group** as the automorphism group of its multiset of prime factors:

\begin{definition}[Internal Symmetry Group of a Factorization]\label{def:internal-symmetry}
Let $X \in \mathcal{U}$ with prime factorization $X \cong \prod_{p\in S} p^{\alpha(p)}$. Consider the multiset 
\[ M_X = \{\!\{ \underbrace{p,\dots,p}_{\alpha(p)\text{ times}} : p\in S \}\!\}, \] 
which lists each prime $p$ exactly $\alpha(p)$ times. The **internal symmetry group** $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is defined as the group of permutations of the elements of $M_X$ that leave the multiset invariant. Concretely, 
\[ 
\mathrm{Sym}(X) \;\cong\; \prod_{p\in S} S_{\alpha(p)}, 
\] 
a direct product of symmetric groups $S_{\alpha(p)}$ for each prime $p$ that appears $\alpha(p)>1$ times. (If $\alpha(p)\le 1$ then $S_{\alpha(p)}$ is trivial.) This group $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ can be thought of as the automorphism group of the factorization of $X$.
\end{definition}

In Definition \ref{def:internal-symmetry}, each factor $p^{\alpha(p)}$ contributes a symmetry of permuting those $\alpha(p)$ identical $p$-factors among themselves. For example, if $X = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$, then $\mathrm{Supp}(X)=\{2,3\}$, and $M_X=\{2,2,2,3,3\}$. The symmetry group is $S_3 \times S_2$: permuting the three 2’s or the two 3’s. In total, $|\mathrm{Sym}(X)|=3! \cdot 2! = 12$ in that case. These symmetries reflect redundancies in listing the factors, not in the object itself (the object remains the same under permutation of factors). 

One might question the role of such symmetries: since the prime factors are truly indistinguishable within each type, $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ does not change any *mathematical property* of $X$. However, these groups become important when one considers **moduli** or classifying spaces of objects. For instance, if one were to consider each factor as an entity, the quotient by these symmetries would avoid overcounting isomorphic factorizations. In category-theoretic terms, $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ could be seen as the automorphism group of the object $X$ in the category defined by this factorization structure. Indeed, $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is precisely the stabilizer of the point $\Phi(X)$ under the natural action of permuting coordinates in the exponent space. (The action in the exponent space is trivial on the vector itself because summing in any order gives the same vector, but the idea is that the labeled decomposition has that symmetry.)

We can summarize an important invariant: the multiset of primes $M_X$ is an invariant of $X$, and its automorphism group $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is an intrinsic symmetry of $X$’s structure. Often, $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is trivial (if all $\alpha(p)\le 1$), but for objects with repeated identical factors, this captures a structural symmetry. In more general domains, internal symmetry could be richer — e.g. if two different primes $p, q$ were isomorphic under some automorphism of the domain, one might extend $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ to include swapping $p$ and $q$ factors. However, in a rigid context like numbers, distinct primes are not automorphic (there’s no nontrivial domain automorphism sending one prime to another unless a symmetry of the entire structure of $\mathcal{U}$ exists). In the absence of such coincidences, $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ is exactly as defined above, coming from duplicate primes.

**Stratified Bundle Structure:** We now connect the stratification with observers. The observer bundle $\mathcal{E}$ can be restricted to each stratum $\mathcal{U}_S$, yielding sub-bundles $\mathcal{E}_S = \pi^{-1}(\mathcal{U}_S) = \mathcal{U}_S \times R$. Because of Proposition \ref{prop:invariance}, each $\mathcal{E}_S$ remains flat with respect to $\Phi$. Moreover, one can often trivialize $\mathcal{E}_S$ by choosing a canonical frame on that stratum (for example, one might choose frame $r_S$ specialized for objects of type $S$). The transition functions between different strata’s trivializations are identity on the overlapping intrinsic data, though going from one stratum to another involves adding or removing primes (which is not continuous in the usual sense, but can be seen as a limit process as mentioned).

The stratification also suggests a **modular perspective**: one might study the “moduli” of objects with a fixed prime support $S$ and then sum over $S$. In such a study, $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ acts as a symmetry on the parameters (exponents) for fixed $S$. For example, to avoid counting symmetric configurations multiple times, one might quotient out by $\prod_{p\in S} S_{\alpha(p)}$ when considering distinct factorizations with identical primes. Such considerations are analogous to studying orbits of a configuration under permutation of identical particles in physics or identical summands in combinatorics.

To ensure we do not stray into speculative territory, we emphasize that all these symmetry and stratification structures are **internal mathematical properties** of the factorization universe. They do not imply any change to the unique factorization principle; rather, they enrich our understanding by highlighting that the space of all factorizations has a well-organized combinatorial geometry. This geometry can be further studied using tools from combinatorial topology or polyhedral geometry (each $\mathcal{U}_S$ corresponds to a positive orthant in a lattice, and the adjacency between strata corresponds to facets where primes drop out).

## Observer-Coupled Sheaf and Categorical Formulation

Lastly, we translate the integration of observers into the language of sheaves and category theory, which provides a high-level view of coherence across different contexts. The observer bundle can be viewed as a sheaf (of sets, or even groupoids) on the object space, and the existence of a canonical global section (the prime frame) corresponds to a particular property of this sheaf.

Consider the discrete topology on $\mathcal{U}$ (since $\mathcal{U}$ is typically not naturally a continuum). We can define a presheaf (indeed a sheaf, given the trivial gluing conditions in a discrete space) $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathcal{U}$ by 
\[ 
\mathcal{F}(U) = U \times R 
\] 
for any subset $U \subseteq \mathcal{U}$, with restriction maps $\mathcal{F}(U)\to \mathcal{F}(V)$ for $V\subseteq U$ given by inclusion on the first component and identity on $R$. Here $\mathcal{F}(U)$ can be thought of as the set of choices of an observer for each object in $U$. Because $\mathcal{U}$ is discrete (or even if it were not, $R$ is fixed and does not depend on $X$), this $\mathcal{F}$ is actually a **constant sheaf** with fiber $R$ (up to the product with the identity section). The existence of a global section $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{U}) = \mathcal{U}\times R$ selecting one frame for every object is automatic in a constant sheaf: one can pick e.g. $(X,r_0)$ for all $X$. However, the coherence conditions impose that the section we pick should correspond to the intrinsic frame that gives $\Phi(X)$ in a direct way.

A more enlightening categorical view is to consider the **fibered category** of frames over objects. Define a category $\mathcal{E}$ whose objects are pairs $(X,r)$ with $X\in \mathcal{U}$ and $r\in R$, and whose morphisms $(X,r)\to (Y,s)$ exist only if $X=Y$ in $\mathcal{U}$ (and then such a morphism can only be the identity on the $X$ and possibly an action on the $r$ to $s$ if we allowed frame morphisms). In essence, $\mathcal{E}$ is a groupoid fibered over $\mathcal{U}$, with $\mathcal{E}_X \cong R$ as the fiber groupoid over each $X$. This fibered category can be thought of as a **stack** (in trivial terms, since there is no intricate gluing here beyond trivial overlaps). The coherence condition that $\Phi(X)$ is invariant can be phrased by saying that $\Phi$ factors through the stack quotient of $\mathcal{E}$ by the action of frame changes. Since that action has no effect on $\Phi$, $\Phi$ actually descends to the coarse moduli (the quotient category where each fiber is collapsed to a point). The existence of a section $\sigma: \mathcal{U}\to \mathcal{E}$ (picking $(X,r_0)$) means this stack is trivial (a product).

In summary, the sheaf/category formulation doesn’t add new constraints beyond restating that the bundle is trivial. But it provides a powerful viewpoint for potential generalizations: if one considered scenarios where $\Phi(X)$ might not be entirely frame-invariant (imagine a weakened unique factorization where an observer could influence how primes are defined in exotic structures), then $\mathcal{F}$ would not be constant and global sections might not exist, leading to a nontrivial torsor (principal bundle) situation. In our current framework, however, $\mathcal{F}$ is trivial and coherence is maintained by a global choice of canonical frame.

**Conclusion:** We have systematically expanded the Prime UOR Framework into more explicitly mathematical territories:

- We introduced a *coherence geometry* viewpoint by defining an observer fiber bundle and demonstrating its flatness (no observer-induced anomalies in prime coordinates). We defined coherence curvature in this context and showed it vanishes under UOR axioms, reinforcing the idea that the structure is invariant and consistent.

- We dissected the object space via a stratification by prime support, revealing a combinatorial moduli space of factor structures. Each stratum is an orthant of exponent parameters, and the adjacency of strata corresponds to primes appearing or disappearing. This provides a scaffold for understanding continuity or limits of structures within $\mathcal{U}$.

- We identified internal symmetry groups $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ associated with each object’s factorization, capturing the permutations of identical components. While these symmetries do not change the object, they are crucial for understanding the counting and classification of factorizations, and they hint at deeper group actions underlying the framework’s combinatorics.

- We cast the observer aspect in sheaf-theoretic terms, showing that one can view the reference frame assignment as a (trivial) sheaf over $\mathcal{U}$, or a fibered category with a simple structure. This categorical lens confirms that the observer can be added as a layer without disturbing the base structure’s invariants, aligning with the idea of a product category $\mathcal{U}\times R$ in the coherent case.

Throughout, we adhered strictly to formal mathematical development, ensuring that these enhancements of the UOR framework are internally consistent and derived from the original axioms without speculative leaps. The resulting picture is one of a robust mathematical framework enriched by geometry (of a discrete sort), symmetry, and category theory — all while preserving the fundamental uniqueness and universality of prime coordinates. This provides a solid foundation for any further work, such as extending the framework to more complex domains (e.g. non-UFD domains, functorial invariants, or even a refined treatment of dynamics as an internal symmetry group acting on states, analogous to how observers act). Each concept introduced here invites deeper algebraic or geometric investigation, but together they demonstrate that the Prime Framework is fertile ground for rigorous structural mathematics beyond its initial formulation.
