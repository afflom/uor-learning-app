### 1. Intrinsic Primes  
**Statement.**  There exists a distinguished set \(P_{\mathcal U}\) of **intrinsic primes**—the irreducible building blocks of the universe of objects—such that no prime can be factored further under the composition operation. citeturn1file9  
**Analysis.**  
- In the integer case, \(P_{\mathcal U}=\{2,3,5,\dots\}\).  
- More generally, in any domain (polynomials, graphs, logical propositions), one identifies its “atoms” (e.g.\ irreducible polynomials, connected components, atomic propositions).  
- This axiom guarantees a common language: *everything* factors into these atoms in a way that underlies all subsequent structure.

### 2. Unique Factorization (UFD Axiom)  
**Statement.**  Every object \(X\) decomposes as  
\[
X\;\cong\;p_1\circ p_2\circ\cdots\circ p_k
\]
with \(p_i\in P_{\mathcal U}\), and this factorization is **unique up to reordering**. citeturn1file0  
**Analysis.**  
- Uniqueness ensures well‑defined “coordinates” (no two different prime‐lists can represent the same object).  
- It parallels the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for integers, but now applies to any UFD domain.  
- Without this, one could not assign a canonical signature to an object.

### 3. Prime‐Coordinate Homomorphism  
**Statement.**  There is an injective map  
\[
\Phi:\mathcal U\;\longrightarrow\;\mathbb Z^{(P_{\mathcal U})},
\]
sending \(X\mapsto(\alpha(p))_{p\in P_{\mathcal U}}\) where \(\alpha(p)\) is the multiplicity of \(p\) in \(X\)’s factorization.  Moreover  
\[
\Phi(X\circ Y)=\Phi(X)+\Phi(Y),
\]
and \(\Phi\) is bijective onto its image. citeturn1file9  
**Analysis.**  
- Converts the “multiplicative” world of objects into an “additive” lattice of exponent‐vectors.  
- Powers and inverses become scalar multiples: \(\Phi(X^k)=k\,\Phi(X)\).  
- This is the precise analog of writing \(n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots\) as the vector \((a_1,a_2,\dots)\).

---

### 4. Canonical Representation Axiom  
**Statement.**  Every object has a unique, **base‑independent**, **frame‑invariant**, **lossless** representation in prime coordinates that **minimizes representational complexity**:  
1. **Uniqueness** of \(\Phi(X)\).  
2. **Base‑independence** (no reliance on positional notation).  
3. **Reference‑frame invariance** (all observers agree on \(\Phi(X)\)).  
4. **Minimal complexity** (the fully factored form attains the smallest possible norm).  
5. **Losslessness** (\(\Phi\) is bijective). citeturn1file10  
**Analysis.**  
- Unlike decimal or binary expansions, the prime signature never changes and is finite even for rationals (\(1/3\mapsto3^{-1}\)).  
- Every alternative description (e.g.\ grouping primes into composites) is strictly more complex under the coherence norm (below).

---

### 5. Coherence Norm  
**Statement.**  Equip \(\mathbb Z^{(P_{\mathcal U})}\) with the \(\ell^2\) norm  
\[
\|X\|_{\mathrm{coh}}
=\Bigl(\sum_{p\in P_{\mathcal U}}\bigl(\Phi(X)(p)\bigr)^2\Bigr)^{1/2}.
\]
Fully prime‑factored decompositions uniquely minimize this norm. citeturn1file0  
**Analysis.**  
- Measures “how tall” the exponent‐vector is.  
- Any composite grouping (treating a non‑prime as atomic) yields a strictly larger norm by the Pythagorean principle.  
- Thus, **coherence** is literally “shortest‑length” in prime‐space.

---

### 6. Coherence Inner Product (Coherence Metric)  
**Statement.**  Define an inner product on exponent‑vectors by  
\[
\langle v,w\rangle_{\mathrm{coh}}
=\sum_{p\in P_{\mathcal U}}v(p)\,w(p),
\]
making \(\mathbb Z^{(P_{\mathcal U})}\) into a Euclidean space in which prime axes are orthonormal. citeturn1file0  
**Analysis.**  
- Turns prime‐space into a bona fide geometric arena.  
- Enables notions of angle, projection, and—via the induced norm—the minimality arguments above.  
- Underlies any geometric or physical analogies (e.g.\ “coherence curvature”).

---

### 7. Trilateral Coherence Axiom  
**Statement.**  A full description of any object requires three inseparable facets:  
1. **Structure** (\(\Phi(X)\), the particle‑like prime signature),  
2. **Dynamics** (how objects transform, e.g.\ \(\Phi(X\circ Y)=\Phi(X)+\Phi(Y)\)),  
3. **Observer** (the reference frame or context of description).  
These must all coherently interlock to form a valid description. citeturn1file0  
**Analysis.**  
- Elevates the “observer” from informal role to a formal fiber‑bundle layer, ensuring invariance under allowed frame changes.  
- Prevents hidden assumptions: every shift of perspective is a symmetry operation in the observer bundle and leaves \(\Phi(X)\) unchanged.  
- Unifies “particle” (structure), “wave” (dynamics), and “measurement” (observer), echoing a tripartite ontology.

#### How They Fit Together  
1. **Intrinsic Primes** establish the atomic vocabulary.  
2. **Unique Factorization** ensures each sentence of atoms is unambiguous.  
3. **Prime‑Coordinate Map** translates sentences into vectors.  
4. **Canonical Representation** guarantees one “dictionary” form for each object.  
5. **Coherence Norm** ranks all descriptions by simplicity—primes win.  
6. **Coherence Inner Product** endows geometry, letting us rigorously speak of curvature, distance, and orthogonality.  
7. **Trilateral Coherence** ties in the observer, making sure every statement remains valid across contexts.  

Everything beyond these seven absolutes—higher‑level constructions, domain‑specific extensions, physics analogies, application to AI or biology—*builds* on this bedrock of rigor and unambiguity.
