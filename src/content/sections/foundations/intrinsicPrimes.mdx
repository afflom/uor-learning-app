        <strong>Definition (Irreducibles):</strong> Let (𝒰, ∘) be a commutative
        monoid with identity element 1 and group of units U(𝒰). An element
        p ∉ U(𝒰) is called <em>irreducible</em> (or an <em>intrinsic prime</em>) if
        whenever p = a ∘ b with a,b ∈ 𝒰, then either a ∈ U(𝒰) or b ∈ U(𝒰).
        These irreducibles serve as the fundamental atoms for factorization.
      </p>
      <p>Intrinsic primes satisfy the following axioms in any Unique
      Factorization Domain (UFD) setting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Irreducibility:</strong> If p = a ∘ b then a or b is a unit
          in U(𝒰).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non‑unit status:</strong> p is not invertible (
          p ∉ U(𝒰)), ensuring p contributes nontrivially to factorization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Atomic generation:</strong> Every x ∉ U(𝒰) can be expressed as
          a finite ∘‑product of irreducibles, establishing the generating set
          P(𝒰).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Illustrative instances:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ℤ under multiplication: P = {2,3,5,…}; the Fundamental Theorem of
          Arithmetic gives both existence and uniqueness of their factorization.
        </li>
        <li>
          k[x], the polynomial ring over a field k: irreducible monic
          polynomials act as primes; analogous factorization holds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monoids of combinatorial objects (e.g. graphs under disjoint union):
          connected components play the role of irreducibles.
        </li>
        <li>
          More exotic UFDs: coordinate rings of affine varieties, cyclotomic
          integers, and domains arising in category-theoretic spectra.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One excludes units U(𝒰) (objects with two‑sided inverses) from the set
        P(𝒰). The resulting prime set P(𝒰) forms the *alphabet* of the Prime
        Framework. Every x ∈ 𝒰	extbackslash U(𝒰) has a unique multiset of
        irreducibles (its “prime signature”) under the UFD axiom, yielding the
        intrinsic coordinate \(φ(x) ∈ ℕ^{(P(𝒰))}\).
