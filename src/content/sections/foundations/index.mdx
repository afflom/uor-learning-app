      <p>
        The <strong>Prime Foundations</strong> delineate the axiomatic and
        algebraic prerequisites for UOR. At their heart lies the Unique
        Factorization Domain (UFD) structure, which ensures an unambiguous
        prime-based coordinate system. Key foundational pillars are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Irreducible Primes (P):</strong> In a commutative monoid
          (𝒰,∘) with unit group U(𝒰), the set P of irreducibles is defined by
          p ∉ U(𝒰) such that p = a∘b ⇒ a∈U or b∈U. These primes generate
          𝒰^× under ∘ and serve as the basis for φ’s coordinate axes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UFD Axiom (Existence & Uniqueness):</strong> Every
        non‑unit x∈𝒰^× factors as x = u∘∏_&#123;i=1&#125;^k p_i with p_i∈P,
          u∈U(𝒰), and this factorization is unique up to reorder and unit
          adjustments. This ensures φ is bijective and well-defined.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Coordinate Isomorphism φ:</strong> Define φ: 𝒰^×→⨁_&#123;p∈P&#125;ℤ via
          φ(x)=(v_p(x))_p, where v_p(x) is the p‑adic valuation. Theorem:
          φ is a group isomorphism mapping ∘ to +, granting access to linear
          algebraic methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coherence Geometry:</strong> Equip φ’s image with ℓ^p-norms
          ∥·∥_p, notably the coherence norm ∥φ(x)∥₂ = √∑|v_p(x)|², and the inner
          product ⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩ = ∑v_p(x)v_p(y). This Euclidean structure yields
          geometric insights into simplicity, orthogonality, and spectral
          properties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In summary, the Prime Foundations guarantee that any UFD supports a
        canonical, Euclidean prime-coordinate embedding. This confluence of
        algebraic rigour and geometric structure is the soil from which
        UOR’s higher concepts—spectral analysis, fibered perspectives, and
        observer coherence—naturally germinate.
