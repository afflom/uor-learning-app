        <strong>Theorem (Unique Factorization Domain):</strong> Let (𝒰, ∘)
        be a commutative monoid in which every non‑unit admits at least one
        factorization into irreducibles, and irreducible factorizations are
        unique up to permutation and unit factors. Such a monoid is called a
        <em>Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)</em>. Concretely, for each x ∉ U(𝒰),
        there exist irreducibles p₁,…,pₖ and unit u such that
      </p>
      <p style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
        x = u ∘ p₁ ∘ p₂ ∘ … ∘ pₖ,
      </p>
      <p>
        and if x = u' ∘ q₁ ∘ … ∘ q_m is any other decomposition with q_j
        irreducible, then k = m and after reordering there exists units ε_i
        with p_i = ε_i ∘ q_i for each i.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proof Sketch:</strong> The proof splits into two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Existence:</strong> Suppose x ∉ U(𝒰). If x is irreducible,
          we are done. Otherwise x = a ∘ b with neither a nor b a unit. By
          well‑foundedness (no infinite descent), a and b admit factorizations
          into irreducibles; concatenating yields a factorization of x.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Invoke Euclid’s Lemma: if p is
          irreducible and p ∣ (a ∘ b), then p ∣ a or p ∣ b. By induction, one
          shows that any two irreducible decompositions of x must coincide in
          multisets of prime factors up to unit adjustments and order.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Examples & Beyond</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In ℤ: 12 = 2² ∘ 3; uniqueness forces that any alternative must be
          reordering of {2,2,3} up to the unit 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the ring ℤ[√−5], 6 = 2 ∘ 3 = (1+√−5) ∘ (1−√−5), a failure of
          uniqueness illustrating that ℤ[√−5] is not a UFD.
        </li>
        <li>
          In advanced UFDs (e.g. coordinate rings of elliptic curves), the
          same principles prescribe unique “prime divisors” with deep geometric
          meaning.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The UFD axiom is the cornerstone of UOR: it guarantees that φ(x)
        (the prime-coordinate map) is well‑defined and bijective onto
        ⨁ₚℕ, forming the algebraic and geometric foundation for further
        coherence and spectral constructions.
