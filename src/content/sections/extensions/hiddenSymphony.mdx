      <p>
        The UOR framework reveals a hidden symphony of coherence underlying all phenomena:
      </p>
      <h3>The Bridge Between Discrete and Continuous Reality</h3>
      <p>
        By generalizing prime exponents to real-valued spectra, UOR unites arithmetic
        discreteness with analytical continuity.
      </p>
      <h3>Consciousness as Mathematical Necessity</h3>
      <p>
        Observer frames are integral mathematical constructs, embedding consciousness into
        the core of UOR.
      </p>
      <h3>Coherence Minimization as Natural Selection</h3>
      <p>
        Evolutionary and algorithmic processes favor minimal-coherence configurations,
        driving complexity reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This universal language of coherence guides both the fabric of reality and our
        understanding of it.
