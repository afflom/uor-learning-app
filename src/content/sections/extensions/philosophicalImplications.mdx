      <p>
        UOR suggests a <em>coherentist metaphysics</em>: the universe is an
        information‐theoretic tapestry of irreducible spectra, where existence
        and meaning emerge from prime-coordinate structures and their coherence
        relations. Key implications include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Informational Ontology:</strong> Postulate I: Entities are
          fully specified by their prime spectra σ_x. ‘Substance’ reduces to
          data in ℤ^{(P)}, and spacetime and materiality arise as emergent
          patterns in coherence manifolds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consciousness Axiom:</strong> Every coherent description
          requires a frame in R; thus subjective experience is structurally
          embedded in UOR. Consciousness corresponds to selection of a global
          section in the observer bundle, enforcing trilateral coherence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mathematical Epistemology:</strong> Mathematical discovery is
          the search for minimal-coherence descriptions. Theorems arise by
          revealing prime‑coordinate simplicity beneath apparent complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evolution and AI:</strong> Learning systems progress by
          reducing coherence norms, mirroring how natural selection drives
          towards efficient genetic and behavioral encodings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social & Cultural Dynamics:</strong> Societies and languages
          evolve to optimize coherence of shared information, with memes as
          prime units minimizing conceptual complexity.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Philosophical Synthesis</h4>
      <p>
        From this vantage, knowledge acquisition is a minimization of coherence
        divergence: proofs and observations converge to primal spectra with
        maximal parsimony. Human and artificial cognition can be modeled as
        gradient descent in coherence space, exploring manifold of possible
        spectra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, UOR’s philosophical vision points to a <em>pan-coherentism</em>:
        mind, matter, mathematics, and metaphysics are facets of a single
        coherence geometry. Advancing this perspective may yield new paradigms
        for consciousness science, epistemology, and the synthesis of
        scientific disciplines.
      </p>
      <p>
        This perspective unifies mind, matter, and mathematics: all phenomena
        are manifestations of coherence geometry, and understanding emerges from
        locating minimal‐norm representations in prime-coordinate space.
