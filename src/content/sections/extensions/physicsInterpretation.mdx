      <p>
        By interpreting the prime-coordinate manifold (⨁_{p}ℝ) as a
        geometric arena, UOR recasts physical quantities in terms of coherence
        norms, curvatures, and fields:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Coherence Curvature (Gravity):</strong> Define a connection
          ∇ on the observer bundle E₂ with metric induced by ∥·∥₂. The curvature
          tensor R measures noncommutativity of covariant derivatives of φ:
          R(X,Y)φ = ∇_X∇_Yφ − ∇_Y∇_Xφ. Mass distributions induce nonzero R,
          generating geodesic deviation in prime-space (gravity analogue).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prime Density (Mass):</strong> Define m_i = ∥φ(x)∥₂ as the
          inertial mass, resisting acceleration in coherence space, and define
          gravitational mass via coupling term L_int = g⟨φ(x),A⟩ in a coherence
          gauge potential A.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spatial Extent (Volume):</strong> For a subset of primes S,
          define Vol_S(x) = |supp(φ(x))∩S| or its Lebesgue measure under a continuous
          generalization, analogously measuring the spread of coherence across
          S.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Energy:</strong> The <em>potential</em> for transforming prime
          exponents. Kinetic energy tracks active movement in prime space, while
          potential energy measures coherence tension between configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Material:</strong> Stable coherence patterns—distinct prime
          spectra—for different substances. Chemical bonds align prime exponents
          to minimize coherence cost.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Outlook:</strong> Field theories can be formulated via an action
        S[φ] = ∫ (½‖dφ‖² − V(φ)) dμ, where dφ encodes discrete prime gradients.
        Spacetime emerges as a moduli space of observer frames, gravity as
        coherence curvature, and quantum states as superpositions of spectra
        in a Hilbert-completed prime space. This paradigm opens a path toward
        a prime‑space quantum gravity and coherence‑driven cosmology.
