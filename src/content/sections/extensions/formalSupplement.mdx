      <h3>Unique Factorization Domain Axiom</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Axiom (UFD):</strong> Let <code>𝒰</code> be a category with
        finite products and a distinguished set of irreducible objects{' '}
        <code>P</code>. We require:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Every non‑unit object <code>X∈𝒰</code> admits a finite decomposition
          <code>X ≅ p₁∘…∘pₖ</code> with <code>pᵢ∈P</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          This decomposition is unique: if
          <code>X ≅ q₁∘…∘qₘ</code> is another, then m=k and there is a
          permutation σ with <code>qᵢ≅p₍σ(i)₎</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Category-Theoretic Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        Model <code>𝒰</code> as a monoidal category (with ∘ as tensor product).
        Intrinsic primes are the atoms in its subobject lattice. The prime
        coordinate map φ is a strong monoidal functor
        <code>{'φ: (𝒰,∘,1) → (ℤ^{(P)},+,0)'}</code>, preserving tensor and unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Precisely, φ(X∘Y)=φ(X)+φ(Y), φ(1)=0, and φ is initial among all such
        homomorphisms (universal property): any other functor to an abelian
        group factors uniquely through φ.
      </p>

      <h3>Sheaf & Stack Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        Observers form a fibered category (stack) over 𝒰: assign to each X the
        groupoid of frames R. The total category E₂ has objects (X,r) and
        morphisms only in frames. The canonical frame section σ: X↦(X,r₀)
        exhibits E₂ as a trivial torsor, ensuring global coherence and flatness
        of the bundle.
      </p>

      <h3>Extensions to Dedekind Domains</h3>
      <p>
        In a domain lacking unique factorization (e.g., ℤ[√−5]), one refines
        primes to prime ideals. Working in the category of fractional ideals
        restores the UFD axiom: every ideal factors uniquely. The UOR coordinate
        extends to the ideal class group, encoding ideal exponents in the prime
        ideal basis.
      </p>

      <h3>Base‑Absolute Prime Coordinates</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> A coordinate system is{' '}
        <em>base‑absolute</em>
        if it is canonical and independent of any chosen basis or chart. The UOR
        prime coordinate φ is base‑absolute: it does not depend on numeral base,
        vector space basis, or presentation. It is intrinsic to the object’s
        structure.
      </p>

      <h3>Primary Decomposition in Modules</h3>
      <p>
        For modules over Noetherian rings, primary decomposition generalizes
        prime factorization. Each submodule decomposes into intersections of
        primary submodules, yielding coordinates in the lattice of primary
        components. A coherence metric may rank decompositions by simplicity.
      </p>

      <h3>Universal Properties & Limits of UOR</h3>
      <p>
        φ enjoys a universal mapping property: any functor from 𝒰 to a graded
        abelian group preserving composition factors through φ. UOR is the
        terminal coordinate system under this constraint.
      </p>

      <h3>Case Studies in Pure Math</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Polynomial Rings:</strong> φ maps f(x) to exponent vector of
          irreducible factors, enabling gcd/lcm of polynomials by componentwise
          min/max.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Algebraic Number Theory:</strong> φ on ideals tracks
          ramification exponents in Galois extensions, unifying decomposition
          groups and Frobenius actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Group Representation:</strong> Decompose representations into
          irreducibles; assign coordinate of multiplicities, turning tensor
          products into vector addition.
        </li>
