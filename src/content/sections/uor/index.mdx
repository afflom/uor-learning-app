      <p>
        The <strong>Universal Object Reference (UOR)</strong> is a formalism that
        associates to every element x in a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) a
        canonical coordinate φ(x) in the free abelian group \(\bigoplus_{p\in P}\mathbb{Z}\) of prime
        valuations. UOR integrates algebraic, geometric, and observer-oriented
        perspectives into a single coherent framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formally, UOR comprises:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prime Generators P:</strong> The set of irreducibles in 𝒰,
          defined by p ∉ U(𝒰) and p irreducible. These form the basis directions
          of UOR’s coordinate lattice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UFD Axiom:</strong> 𝒰 satisfies existence and uniqueness of prime
          factorizations: every x ∈ 𝒰^× decomposes as a product of primes up to ν,
          and this decomposition is unique (modulo units and order).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coordinate Functor φ:</strong> The group isomorphism φ:
          \(𝒰^×,∘\)→\(\bigoplus_{p\in P}\mathbb{Z},+\), with φ(x)=(v_p(x))_p and φ(x∘y)=φ(x)+φ(y),
          φ(x^n)=n·φ(x).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Canonical Normal Form:</strong> φ(x) is injective, minimal
          in ℓ2-norm, independent of numeral base, and invariant under UFD
          automorphisms. This normal form is the unique data-preserving
          representative of x.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coherence Norm & Metric:</strong> By endowing prime space with an
          ℓ²‑norm ‖φ(X)‖ = √(∑_p φ(X)(p)²) and inner product ⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p),
          we impose a Euclidean geometry on factorizations. This metric measures
          representational simplicity (smaller norm = more coherent) and defines
          distances and angles between objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fiber Bundle Structure:</strong> A two‑level bundle formalism:
          Level 1 fibers over each prime capture exponent values, while Level 2
          fibers over each object capture observer reference frames. Sections of
          these bundles correspond to prime factorizations and frame selections,
          unifying structure and perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trilateral Coherence:</strong> The axiom that any complete
          description of an object intertwines three aspects—intrinsic structure
          (prime coordinates), dynamics (composition laws), and observer context—
          with frame transformations preserving φ and coherence norms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these components yield a universal coordinate geometry: prime
        space is endowed with an inner-product ⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩ = ∑_p v_p(x)v_p(y),
        a coherence norm ‖φ(x)‖₂, and a hierarchical bundle structure that
        respects object and observer. UOR not only recasts arithmetic in a
        Euclidean setting but also paves the way for higher‑order generalizations—
        to noncommutative primes, categorical primes, and spectral stacks—
        suggesting a universal ontology of coherence across mathematics and
        beyond.
