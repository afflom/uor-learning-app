        <strong>Theorem (General UOR Existence):</strong> Let D be any UFD (or
        GCD domain satisfying factorization axioms). Then the prime-coordinate
        functor φ: D^× → ⨁_{p∈P(D)}ℤ is well-defined, exact, and admits an
        extension to polynomial rings D[x], localizations D_S, and formal power
        series D[[x]], preserving unique factorization in each case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concretely, UOR applies whenever a domain admits a notion of irreducible
        generators P and a UFD-like factorization property. Key examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Polynomial Rings D[x]:</strong> Irreducible monic polynomials
          in D[x] serve as primes; φ encodes factor degrees and coefficients via
          multi-index valuations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combinatorial Monoids:</strong> In incidence algebras, connected
          components decompose uniquely, with φ capturing component counts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Localization & Sheaf Domains:</strong> Local UFDs obtained via
          inverting primes (e.g. local rings at maximal ideals) carry local φ
          maps, gluing into sheaves over Spec(D).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In each context, φ remains injective, multiplicative-additive, and
        coherence‑minimizing, yielding a universal coordinate atlas. This
        universality hints at a grander vision: UOR as a spectrum-level
        invariant extending beyond first-order domains into derived
        categories, spectral stacks, and even the realm of homotopy types,
        where “primes” become indecomposable objects and φ a homotopical
        coordinate functor.
