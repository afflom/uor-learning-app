        <strong>Definition (Canonical Representation):</strong> Let (𝒰, ∘)
        be a UFD and φ: 𝒰^× → ⨁_{p∈P}ℤ its prime-coordinate isomorphism. A
        representation of x∈𝒰^× is <em>canonical</em> if it is given by
        φ(x) = (v_p(x))_{p∈P}. Equivalently, x is expressed as
        x = u ∘ ∏_{p∈P} p^{v_p(x)}, where u∈U(𝒰) is a unit and v_p(x) its valuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Theorem (Canonicity):</strong> The map φ is the unique,
        base‑independent, unit‑adjusted factorization map satisfying:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Injectivity: φ(x)=φ(y) ⇒ x=y in 𝒰^×.</li>
        <li>Minimality: φ(x) minimizes ‖φ(x)‖₂ among all finite decompositions
            of x into irreducibles.</li>
        <li>Frame Invariance: For any automorphism g of 𝒰 preserving UFD structure,
            φ(g(x))=g_*(φ(x)).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>Proof Sketch:</em> Injectivity follows from unique factorization.
        Minimality arises by Pythagorean orthogonality: any alternative grouping
        yields additional orthogonal components. Frame invariance is ensured by
        the functoriality of φ under UFD automorphisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, for each object <code>X</code>, its prime coordinate
        vector <code>φ(X)</code> must satisfy the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Unique:</strong> Exactly one exponent vector corresponds to
          <code>X</code> (by unique factorization).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Base‑Independent:</strong> Unaffected by positional notation
          (decimal, binary, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frame‑Invariant:</strong> Remains the same under any valid
          observer frame change (no ambiguity in grouping).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimally Complex:</strong> Attains the smallest possible
          coherence norm ‖X‖₍coh₎—any grouping into composite factors strictly
          increases the norm.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lossless:</strong> φ is injective and invertible on its image,
          so <code>X</code> can be perfectly reconstructed from φ(X).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> The integer 210 can be encoded in any positional
        system, yet its canonical form is uniquely determined:
        φ(210) = (1,1,1,1) along p∈{2,3,5,7}. Any decomposition like 210=10∘21
        corresponds to φ(10)+φ(21)=(1,1)+(0,1)+(…)= not minimal in ℓ²-distance,
        illustrating the absolutism of the prime spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, the Canonical Representation Axiom elevates φ to the
        intrinsic normal form: it is unique, efficient (coherence‑optimal),
        and immune to external encoding choices. This universal normal form is
        the cornerstone for all subsequent geometric, spectral, and bundle
        constructions in the Prime Framework.
