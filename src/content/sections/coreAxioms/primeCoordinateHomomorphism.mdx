      <h1>Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism</h1>
      
      <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        There exists an injective homomorphism <code>œÜ: ùí∞ ‚Üí ‚Ñ§^(P)</code> mapping each object 
        to its exponent vector over primes, satisfying <code>œÜ(X‚àòY)=œÜ(X)+œÜ(Y)</code>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Deep Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        The Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism establishes a profound connection between objects and 
        their structural coordinates. It transforms the multiplicative world of object composition 
        into an additive vector space, where each prime dimension contributes independently to 
        an object's structure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This mapping œÜ assigns to each object a unique signature: a vector of exponents showing 
        how many times each prime appears in the object's factorization. The power of this 
        homomorphism is that it linearizes composition - combining objects through multiplication 
        corresponds to simply adding their prime coordinate vectors.

      <h3>Mathematical Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        Given a universe of objects <code>ùí∞</code> with composition operation <code>‚àò</code>, 
        and a set of primes <code>P</code>, the prime coordinate map <code>œÜ</code> is defined as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>œÜ(X)(p) = the exponent of prime p in X's factorization</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This satisfies the homomorphism property: <code>œÜ(X‚àòY) = œÜ(X) + œÜ(Y)</code>, transforming 
        composition into vector addition in <code>‚Ñ§^(P)</code>, the space of integer vectors indexed by primes.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Connection to Other Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        This axiom builds on the Unique Factorization axiom, which ensures that œÜ is well-defined. 
        It establishes the foundation for the Coherence Norm and Inner Product, which endow the 
        coordinate space with geometric structure. The Canonical Representation axiom further ensures 
        that this mapping provides the most intrinsic description of any object.
