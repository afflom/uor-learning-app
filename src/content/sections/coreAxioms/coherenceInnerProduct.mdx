      <h1>Coherence Inner Product</h1>
      
      <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Define <code>⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p)</code>, making the exponent space a 
        Euclidean vector space with orthonormal prime axes.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Deep Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        The Coherence Inner Product establishes a geometric framework for understanding 
        object structure. By defining an inner product on prime coordinate vectors, it 
        transforms the abstract space of object compositions into a rich Euclidean geometry 
        where distances, angles, and projections all have meaningful interpretations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This axiom gives mathematical form to the intuition that primes represent independent 
        dimensions of structure. Each prime defines an orthogonal axis in the object space, 
        allowing us to describe the structure of objects with the full power of Euclidean 
        geometry. This geometric perspective reveals deep insights about how objects relate 
        to one another based on their prime compositions.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Structure:</strong> Transforms prime coordinates from a purely 
          algebraic tool into a geometric space where intuitive concepts like distance 
          and angle apply.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Orthogonality of Primes:</strong> Different primes represent truly 
          independent aspects of structure, forming orthogonal bases in the coordinate space.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Similarity Measure:</strong> The inner product provides a measure of structural 
          similarity between objects - those with similar prime compositions have larger inner products.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mathematical Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        On the prime coordinate space <code>ℤ^(P)</code>, define the inner product 
        <code>⟨·,·⟩: ℤ^(P) × ℤ^(P) → ℝ</code> as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p)</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        For objects <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> with prime coordinates <code>φ(X)</code> and <code>φ(Y)</code>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>⟨φ(X),φ(Y)⟩ = ∑_p φ(X)(p)·φ(Y)(p)</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This inner product satisfies the axioms of a Euclidean space, with the prime basis elements forming an orthonormal system.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Connection to Other Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        The Coherence Inner Product extends the Coherence Norm (which is derived from it as 
        <code>‖v‖ = √⟨v,v⟩</code>) and provides the geometric foundation for understanding 
        the Canonical Representation axiom. It also connects to the Trilateral Coherence axiom 
        by enabling precise descriptions of how object structure appears from different perspectives 
        in the observer bundle.
