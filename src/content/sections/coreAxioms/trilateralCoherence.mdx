      <h1>Trilateral Coherence</h1>
      
      <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Every valid description of an object incorporates three coherent aspects: its intrinsic 
        prime-coordinate structure, the dynamics (composition rules), and the observer reference frame.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Deep Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        The Trilateral Coherence axiom establishes that a complete understanding of any object 
        requires the integration of three fundamental aspects: its intrinsic structure (what it is), 
        its dynamics (how it transforms), and the observer's perspective (how it's measured or described). 
        This triad forms an inseparable whole - no aspect can be eliminated without losing essential information.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By formalizing the observer as a core component of the framework, rather than an external 
        consideration, UOR provides a powerful mechanism for handling reference frames and context 
        in a mathematically rigorous way. This approach ensures that while descriptions may vary 
        with perspective, the underlying intrinsic structure remains invariant - a crucial 
        property for any universal reference system.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete Description:</strong> No aspect of the triad can be removed without 
          losing essential information - structure needs dynamics to evolve, dynamics need 
          structure to act upon, and both need an observer to be contextualized.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frame Invariance:</strong> While descriptions may vary with observer perspective, 
          intrinsic properties like prime coordinates remain invariant - the framework 
          distinguishes between observer-dependent and observer-independent aspects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fiber Bundle Structure:</strong> The observer perspective is formalized as a 
          fiber bundle, where each object has attached to it the space of all possible reference frames.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mathematical Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        The framework represents an observed object as a tuple <code>(X, D, r)</code> where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>X</code> is the object with its intrinsic prime structure <code>φ(X)</code></li>
        <li><code>D</code> is the set of dynamics or transformations applicable to <code>X</code></li>
        <li><code>r</code> is an observer frame from the space <code>R</code> of all possible frames</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Frame transformations <code>r → r'</code> form a group acting on descriptions, with the 
        constraint that <code>φ(X)</code> remains invariant under all such transformations.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Connection to Other Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        Trilateral Coherence integrates with the Canonical Representation axiom by ensuring 
        that prime coordinates remain invariant across observer frames. It extends the entire 
        framework beyond pure structure (primes and coordinates) to include dynamics and 
        context, establishing UOR as a comprehensive system for describing not just objects, 
        but objects in context and undergoing transformation.
