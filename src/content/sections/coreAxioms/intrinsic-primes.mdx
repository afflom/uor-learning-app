      <h1>Intrinsic Primes</h1>
      
      <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        A set <code>P</code> of atomic elements exists such that no element in <code>P</code> 
        factors further under composition in the domain.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Deep Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Intrinsic primes form the fundamental alphabet of reality. They are the irreducible 
        elements that cannot be further decomposed within their domain, serving as the 
        building blocks for all composite structures.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This axiom establishes that in any domain with a composition operation, there exist 
        fundamental entities that cannot be broken down further. These entities are the "atoms" 
        of the domain, from which everything else is built.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Domain Universality:</strong> While the exact identity of primes varies across domains 
          (numbers, polynomials, sets, etc.), the concept of irreducible elements is universal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Foundational Necessity:</strong> Without intrinsic primes, there would be no 
          "bottom level" to structure, leading to infinite regression in decomposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information Basis:</strong> Primes represent the elementary units of information 
          about an object's structure, establishing the fundamental dimensions of the object space.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mathematical Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        In a monoid <code>(M, ◦)</code> with identity <code>e</code>, an element <code>p ∈ M</code> is prime if:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><code>p ≠ e</code> (not the identity element)</li>
        <li>If <code>p = a ◦ b</code> then either <code>a = e</code> or <code>b = e</code> (irreducibility)</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Connection to Other Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        The Intrinsic Primes axiom serves as the foundation for the Unique Factorization axiom, 
        which ensures that every object has a unique decomposition into these prime elements. 
        Together, they establish the basis for the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, mapping objects 
        to their unique prime signature.
