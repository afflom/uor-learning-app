      <h1>Unique Factorization (UFD Axiom)</h1>
      
      <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Every non‑unit object admits a finite product decomposition into primes, and 
        this decomposition is unique up to reordering of factors.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Deep Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        The Unique Factorization axiom ensures that any object in the universe can be decomposed 
        into a unique combination of intrinsic primes. This profound property establishes 
        that every object has a singular, canonical representation in terms of its most 
        fundamental components.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This axiom is the universal extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, 
        which states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a unique 
        product of prime numbers (up to their order). The UOR framework extends this principle 
        to arbitrary domains, creating a universal language for describing structure.

      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Structural Fingerprint:</strong> Unique factorization provides each object with 
          a distinctive "fingerprint" - its prime signature - that uniquely identifies it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Canonical Representation:</strong> UFD guarantees the existence of a single, 
          objective way to decompose any object, eliminating ambiguity in structural analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Isomorphism Foundation:</strong> This axiom enables the faithful mapping between 
          objects and their coordinate representations, preserving all structural information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mathematical Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        In a unique factorization domain (UFD) <code>D</code>, every non-zero non-unit element 
        <code>x ∈ D</code> can be expressed as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>x = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        where each <code>pᵢ</code> is a prime in <code>D</code>. Furthermore, this representation 
        is unique up to reordering and multiplication by units.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Connection to Other Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        This axiom builds directly on the Intrinsic Primes axiom and serves as the foundation for 
        the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism. Unique factorization is what allows the homomorphism 
        to be well-defined and injective, enabling the consistent mapping of objects to their 
        prime coordinate vectors.
