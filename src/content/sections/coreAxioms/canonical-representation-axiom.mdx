      <h1>Canonical Representation</h1>
      
      <h2>Formal Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The image <code>œÜ(X)</code> is a unique, lossless encoding that does not depend 
        on numeral base or observer frame and achieves the minimal coherence norm among 
        all representations.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Deep Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        The Canonical Representation axiom establishes that an object's prime coordinate 
        signature is its most fundamental, observer-independent description. Unlike 
        conventional representations that may vary with base or perspective, the prime 
        factorization provides an absolute reference that captures the intrinsic structure 
        of any object.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This axiom addresses the profound question: "What is the most natural way to 
        represent an object?" The answer is through its irreducible components - its prime 
        factors. This representation is canonical in the strongest sense - it is invariant 
        across all valid frames of reference and achieves minimal complexity.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Base Independence:</strong> Unlike decimal or binary expansions, prime 
          coordinates do not depend on arbitrary choices of base or numeral system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frame Invariance:</strong> The prime signature remains unchanged regardless 
          of observer perspective, providing an absolute reference point.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimal Complexity:</strong> The prime factorization achieves the lowest 
          possible coherence norm, making it objectively the simplest representation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Information Completeness:</strong> No structural information is lost in the 
          prime encoding; the original object can be perfectly reconstructed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Mathematical Formalization</h3>
      <p>
        For any object <code>X</code> in the universe <code>ùí∞</code>, the map <code>œÜ: ùí∞ ‚Üí ‚Ñ§^(P)</code> satisfies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Injectivity: If <code>œÜ(X) = œÜ(Y)</code> then <code>X = Y</code></li>
        <li>Base invariance: <code>œÜ(X)</code> does not depend on positional notation system</li>
        <li>Frame invariance: <code>œÜ(X)</code> is the same in all valid observer frames</li>
        <li>Minimal coherence: <code>‚ÄñœÜ(X)‚Äñ</code> ‚â§ <code>‚ÄñR(X)‚Äñ</code> for any other representation <code>R</code></li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Connection to Other Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        This axiom builds on the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism and interacts closely with the 
        Coherence Norm, which provides the metric for measuring representational complexity. 
        It also connects to the Trilateral Coherence axiom by ensuring that the object's 
        intrinsic structure remains invariant across observer frames.
