# Prime Formula

The Prime Formula provides a formal mathematical definition of the prime decomposition and valuation process in a Unique Factorization Domain.

## Canonical Factorization

For any non-zero non-unit element x in a Unique Factorization Domain D, the canonical prime factorization is given by:

x = u · p₁^e₁ · p₂^e₂ · ... · pₙ^eₙ

where:
- u is a unit in D
- Each pᵢ is a distinct prime in D
- eᵢ is the exponent (valuation) of prime pᵢ
- The product is finite (only finitely many primes have non-zero exponents)

## Prime Valuation

The prime valuation function v_p(x) returns the highest power of prime p that divides x.

For example, v_2(12) = 2 because 2² divides 12, but 2³ does not.

This function has several important properties:

1. v_p(xy) = v_p(x) + v_p(y) for all x, y
2. v_p(x+y) ≥ min(v_p(x), v_p(y)) with equality when v_p(x) ≠ v_p(y)
3. v_p(1) = 0 for all primes p
4. v_p(p) = 1 for prime p

## The Prime-Coordinate Map

The valuation function extends to define the prime-coordinate map φ:

φ(x) = (v_p(x))_p

This maps each element to its vector of prime exponents, forming the mathematical basis for the UOR framework's representation system.
