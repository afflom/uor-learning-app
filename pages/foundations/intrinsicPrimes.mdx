# Intrinsic Primes

Intrinsic primes form the fundamental building blocks of the UOR framework, serving as the irreducible elements from which all objects are composed.

## Definition

An element p in a domain D is called an **intrinsic prime** if it satisfies these conditions:

1. **Irreducibility:** p cannot be expressed as a product of two non-unit elements in D
2. **Non-unit:** p is not a unit (invertible element) in D
3. **Prime property:** If p divides a product ab, then p divides either a or b

## Key Properties

Intrinsic primes possess several critical features that make them suitable as a coordinate basis:

- **Domain independence:** The concept generalizes across number systems, polynomials, and abstract domains
- **Uniqueness:** Each prime represents a distinct, indivisible aspect of object structure
- **Completeness:** The set of all primes is sufficient to express any object through composition

## Role in UOR

Within the Universal Object Reference framework, intrinsic primes serve as:

- **Coordinate axes:** Each prime defines an independent dimension in object space
- **Information atoms:** The smallest units of structural information
- **Spectral components:** Fundamental frequencies in an object's composition

This prime foundation ensures that every object has a canonical decomposition into its most basic constituents, enabling unambiguous reference and comparison across observer frames.
