# Prime Coordinates

Prime coordinates provide a powerful mapping system that transforms objects into vectors in an exponent space, revealing their intrinsic structure.

## The Prime-Coordinate Map

For any object x in a domain with unique factorization, the prime-coordinate map φ assigns to x its vector of prime exponents:

- φ(x) maps each prime p to its exponent in the factorization of x
- The result is a vector in the exponent space (typically Z^P for finite products)
- This mapping is a homomorphism: φ(x·y) = φ(x) + φ(y)

## Properties of Prime Coordinates

The prime-coordinate representation has several remarkable properties:

- **Injectivity:** Distinct objects map to distinct coordinate vectors
- **Linearization:** Multiplication becomes vector addition in coordinate space
- **Dimension reduction:** Infinite objects represented by finite vectors
- **Base independence:** Representation is intrinsic, not tied to numeral systems

## Geometric Interpretation

Viewing prime coordinates geometrically reveals deep structure:

- Each prime corresponds to an orthogonal dimension
- Objects become points in a discrete lattice
- Divisibility relations become geometric containment
- Prime powers trace rays along coordinate axes

This coordinate system transforms the multiplicative structure into an additive vector space, making complex patterns of factorization visually and algebraically accessible.
