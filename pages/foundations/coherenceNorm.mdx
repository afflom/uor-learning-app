# Coherence Norm & Metric

The coherence norm provides a fundamental measure of representational complexity in prime-coordinate space.

## Definition and Properties

For an object x with prime-coordinate representation Ï†(x), the coherence norm is defined as the Euclidean norm of the exponent vector. This norm has several key properties:

- **Non-negativity:** The norm is always positive for non-unit elements
- **Triangle Inequality:** The norm of a product is bounded by the sum of norms
- **Invariance:** The norm is invariant under canonical transformations

## Minimality Theorem

Among all possible factorizations of an object, the prime factorization minimizes the coherence norm. This can be proven through the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and establishes prime representation as the most efficient encoding.

## Metric Space Structure

The coherence norm induces a metric on the space of objects, defined as the norm of the quotient. This metric satisfies:

- **Identity:** d(x,y) = 0 if and only if x = y
- **Symmetry:** d(x,y) = d(y,x)
- **Triangle Inequality:** d(x,z) â‰¤ d(x,y) + d(y,z)

## Euclidean Structure

Prime-coordinate space inherits a full Euclidean structure through the inner product of exponent vectors. This allows for notions of angles, projections, and orthogonality between object representations.

## Applications

The coherence norm and metric enable:

- Measuring information content of mathematical objects
- Quantifying similarity between structures
- Defining notions of complexity and simplicity
- Establishing optimization criteria for representations

Through the coherence norm, UOR provides a rigorous foundation for comparing and analyzing mathematical objects based on their intrinsic prime structure.
