# Unique Factorization

The principle of Unique Factorization forms the essential foundation of the UOR framework, guaranteeing that objects have unambiguous prime representations.

## The Fundamental Theorem

In a Unique Factorization Domain, every non-zero non-unit element x can be expressed as a product of irreducible elements (primes) in an essentially unique way:

x = u · p₁ · p₂ · ... · pₙ

where u is a unit, each pᵢ is prime, and the representation is unique up to reordering of factors and multiplication by units.

## Uniqueness Guarantee

The power of this theorem lies in its uniqueness clause: if

x = u · p₁ · p₂ · ... · pₙ = v · q₁ · q₂ · ... · qₘ

where u and v are units and the pᵢ and qⱼ are primes, then:

1. n = m (same number of prime factors)
2. After reordering, pᵢ and qᵢ are associates (differ by a unit) for each i

## Examples and Applications

- **Integers:** Every integer > 1 factors uniquely into primes (e.g., 60 = 2² · 3 · 5)
- **Polynomials:** p(x) = (x-1)²(x+2) has unique factorization into irreducibles
- **Gaussian Integers:** a+bi factors uniquely using Gaussian primes

## Significance for UOR

Unique factorization ensures that:

- Every object has exactly one prime-coordinate representation
- The mapping to prime-coordinate space is well-defined
- Objects can be unambiguously compared and analyzed

This principle establishes the foundation for the entire coherence framework by guaranteeing that each object's intrinsic structure can be captured uniquely in its prime spectrum.
