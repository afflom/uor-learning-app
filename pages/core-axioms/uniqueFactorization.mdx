# Unique Factorization (UFD Axiom)

## Formal Statement

Every non‑unit object admits a finite product decomposition into primes, and this decomposition is unique up to reordering of factors.

## Deep Exploration

The Unique Factorization axiom ensures that any object in the universe can be decomposed into a unique combination of intrinsic primes. This profound property establishes that every object has a singular, canonical representation in terms of its most fundamental components.

This axiom is the universal extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a unique product of prime numbers (up to their order). The UOR framework extends this principle to arbitrary domains, creating a universal language for describing structure.

### Key Insights

- **Structural Fingerprint:** Unique factorization provides each object with a distinctive "fingerprint" - its prime signature - that uniquely identifies it.

- **Canonical Representation:** UFD guarantees the existence of a single, objective way to decompose any object, eliminating ambiguity in structural analysis.

- **Isomorphism Foundation:** This axiom enables the faithful mapping between objects and their coordinate representations, preserving all structural information.

### Mathematical Formalization

In a unique factorization domain (UFD) `D`, every non-zero non-unit element `x ∈ D` can be expressed as:

`x = p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ`

where each `pᵢ` is a prime in `D`. Furthermore, this representation is unique up to reordering and multiplication by units.

### Connection to Other Axioms

This axiom builds directly on the Intrinsic Primes axiom and serves as the foundation for the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism. Unique factorization is what allows the homomorphism to be well-defined and injective, enabling the consistent mapping of objects to their prime coordinate vectors.
