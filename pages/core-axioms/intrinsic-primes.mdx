# Intrinsic Primes

## Formal Statement

A set `P` of atomic elements exists such that no element in `P` factors further under composition in the domain.

## Deep Exploration

Intrinsic primes form the fundamental alphabet of reality. They are the irreducible elements that cannot be further decomposed within their domain, serving as the building blocks for all composite structures.

This axiom establishes that in any domain with a composition operation, there exist fundamental entities that cannot be broken down further. These entities are the "atoms" of the domain, from which everything else is built.

### Key Insights

- **Domain Universality:** While the exact identity of primes varies across domains (numbers, polynomials, sets, etc.), the concept of irreducible elements is universal.

- **Foundational Necessity:** Without intrinsic primes, there would be no "bottom level" to structure, leading to infinite regression in decomposition.

- **Information Basis:** Primes represent the elementary units of information about an object's structure, establishing the fundamental dimensions of the object space.

### Mathematical Formalization

In a monoid `(M, ◦)` with identity `e`, an element `p ∈ M` is prime if:

1. `p ≠ e` (not the identity element)
2. If `p = a ◦ b` then either `a = e` or `b = e` (irreducibility)

### Connection to Other Axioms

The Intrinsic Primes axiom serves as the foundation for the Unique Factorization axiom, which ensures that every object has a unique decomposition into these prime elements. Together, they establish the basis for the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism, mapping objects to their unique prime signature.
