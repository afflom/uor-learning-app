# Core UOR Axioms

The Seven Core UOR Axioms codify the essential properties ensuring
that any Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) supports a fully coherent,
observer‚Äêaware, prime‚Äêcoordinate representation. These axioms act as
the logical scaffolding underpinning the entire Prime Framework:

1. ### Intrinsic Primes
   
   **Statement.** A set `P` of atomic elements
   exists such that no element in `P` factors further under
   composition in the domain.
   
   **Analysis.** These primes serve as the alphabet for
   every object's unique decomposition. Units (identity elements) are
   excluded from `P`, leaving irreducible generators of the
   composition monoid.

2. ### Unique Factorization (UFD Axiom)
   
   **Statement.** Every non‚Äëunit object admits a finite
   product decomposition into primes, and this decomposition is unique
   up to reordering of factors.
   
   **Analysis.** Guarantees each object has one and only
   one prime signature‚Äîessential for defining unambiguous coordinates.

3. ### Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism
   
   **Statement.** There exists an injective homomorphism
   `œÜ: ùí∞ ‚Üí ‚Ñ§^P` mapping each object to its exponent
   vector over primes, satisfying `œÜ(X‚àòY)=œÜ(X)+œÜ(Y)`.
   
   **Analysis.** This functorial map linearizes
   composition, turning multiplicative relations into vector addition
   and enabling algebraic and geometric techniques.

4. ### Canonical Representation
   
   **Statement.** The image `œÜ(X)` is a unique,
   lossless encoding that does not depend on numeral base or observer
   frame and achieves the minimal coherence norm among all
   representations.
   
   **Analysis.** Establishes the fully factored prime form
   as the intrinsic normal form for every object.

5. ### Coherence Norm
   
   **Statement.** Equip `‚Ñ§^P` with the
   norm measuring simplicity of the prime exponent vector.
   
   **Analysis.** Any non‚Äëprime grouping increases this
   norm, making the prime decomposition the shortest (most coherent)
   vector.

6. ### Coherence Inner Product
   
   **Statement.** Define
   an inner product, making the exponent space a
   Euclidean vector space with orthonormal prime axes.
   
   **Analysis.** Enables distances, angles, and
   projections in prime-coordinate geometry, underpinning spectral and
   geometric interpretations.

7. ### Trilateral Coherence
   
   **Statement.** Every valid description of an object
   incorporates three coherent aspects: its intrinsic prime-coordinate
   structure, the dynamics (composition rules), and the observer
   reference frame.
   
   **Analysis.** By formalizing observers as a bundle with
   frame transformations preserving œÜ, UOR ensures invariant intrinsic
   data while accommodating perspective shifts.

8. ### Universal Mapping Property
   
   **Statement.** The prime-coordinate homomorphism is the initial object among all monoid homomorphisms to abelian groups that send units to zero.
   
   **Proof Sketch.** Since œÜ is surjective onto the free abelian
   group and units lie in its kernel, any œà factors through the quotient
   using a suitable mapping. Uniqueness follows from the fact that the p-th
   basis element must map to œà(p), fixing the homomorphism on generators.
   
   #### Examples of Factorization through œÜ
   
   - **Liouville Function Œª:** Multiplicative function assigning +1 or -1 based on number of prime factors
   
   - **p-adic Valuation:** For fixed prime p‚ÇÄ, measures its exponent in factorization
   
   - **Totient Function œÜ‚ÇÄ:** Euler's function counting numbers coprime to n

   These illustrate that any classical multiplicative arithmetic function
   arises via composition with œÜ. The Universal Mapping Property thus
   characterizes œÜ as the *source of all multiplicative invariants*.

Together, these axioms guarantee that every object can be
assigned an unambiguous prime‚Äêcoordinate spectrum, situated in a
Euclidean lattice and coherently contextualized by an observer frame.
This trilogy of structure, dynamics, and perspective forms a robust
foundation for exploring deep connections‚Äîfrom number theory to quantum
geometry‚Äîand for forging new mathematical and physical vistas beyond
the classical horizon.
