# Core UOR Axioms

In this flagship section we present the Seven Core Axioms that form the logical and geometric foundation of the Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework. These axioms guarantee that every object in a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) can be mapped to a unique, minimal prime-coordinate representation, while remaining invariant under observer transformations.

## 1. Intrinsic Primes

**Definition**  
An *intrinsic prime* is an irreducible element in a composition monoid U. Concretely, P is the set of all p in U such that whenever p = x o y, either x or y is a unit (identity element).

**Key Terms**  
- **Monoid (U)**: A set with an associative binary operation (o) and a unit element e such that e o x = x o e = x.  
- **Unit**: An element u in U satisfying u o x = x o u = x for all x in U.  
- **Irreducible**: A non-unit element that cannot be factored into non-unit factors.

**Discussion**  
Intrinsic primes serve as the atomic building blocks of U. Excluding units ensures each prime contributes essential, non-redundant structure.

**Example**  
In the positive integers under multiplication, P = {2, 3, 5, 7, "etc"}. In the polynomial ring R[x], linear polynomials and other non-factorable polynomials over R are primes.

## 2. Unique Factorization

**Statement**  
Every non-unit element x in U admits a finite factorization:
```  
x = p1 o p2 o ... o pk,  
```  
where each pi is in P, and any two such factorizations differ only by insertion of units and permutation of prime factors.

**Key Terms**  
- **Factorization**: Expression of x as a product of primes and possibly units.  
- **Uniqueness (up to units and permutation)**: If x = p1 o ... o pk and x = q1 o ... o ql, then k = l and there exists a permutation s such that pi is associated to q_s(i) up to a unit factor.

**Discussion**  
This axiom ensures each object has a single, well-defined "prime signature," which is crucial for unambiguous coordinate assignment.

**Example**  
In N, 12 = 2 o 2 o 3 uniquely (apart from ordering); no other set of primes multiplies to 12.

## 3. Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism

**Statement**  
There exists an injective monoid homomorphism:
```  
phi: U -> Z^P  
```  
mapping each object x to its exponent vector phi(x) that records the multiplicity of each prime, satisfying phi(x o y) = phi(x) + phi(y).

**Key Terms**  
- **Monoid Homomorphism**: A map preserving the operation and unit: phi(x o y) = phi(x) + phi(y), phi(e) = 0.  
- **Exponent Vector**: The vector of integer exponents that records the count of each prime factor.

**Discussion**  
This map linearizes composition, enabling algebraic and geometric techniques by translating factorization into addition in Z^P.

**Example**  
For x = 12 in N, phi(12) has v_2 = 2, v_3 = 1, and v_p = 0 for all other primes.

## 4. Canonical Representation

**Statement**  
Each phi(x) is the unique, base- and frame-independent encoding of x that minimizes a chosen coherence norm (see Axiom 5).

**Discussion**  
This fixes a "normal form" for each object, preventing ambiguities due to arbitrary ordering or numeral bases.

**Example**  
Whether written as 2 × 2 × 3 or 3 × 2 × 2, the canonical representation of 12 is the exponent vector (2, 1, 0, 0, ...).

## 5. Coherence Norm

**Statement**  
Equip Z^P with a norm ||·|| measuring representational simplicity (e.g. L1 or L2 norm on exponent vectors). The canonical phi(x) is the minimizer of this norm among all representations of x.

**Key Terms**  
- **Norm (||v||)**: A function assigning length or size to vector v in Z^P, such as L1: ||v||_1 = Sum|v_p|, or L2: sqrt(Sum v_p^2).

**Discussion**  
Minimizing this norm enforces the atomic prime decomposition as the simplest form.

## 6. Coherence Inner Product

**Statement**  
Define an inner product on Z^P by extending the prime basis to an orthonormal set. This makes Z^P a Euclidean space and enables geometric concepts (angles, projections).

**Key Terms**  
- **Inner Product**: A bilinear map satisfying symmetry and positive-definiteness.  
- **Orthonormal Basis**: A set of vectors of unit length and mutual orthogonality.

**Discussion**  
This structure underlies spectral interpretations and distance-based similarity measures between objects.

## 7. Trilateral Coherence

**Statement**  
A complete description of any object involves three interwoven aspects:  
1. Its intrinsic prime-coordinate vector (structure).  
2. The composition rules (dynamics).  
3. The observer reference frame (context).

**Discussion**  
Modeling observers as a fiber bundle over Z^P ensures that phi and the coherence structures are invariant under frame transformations.

## 8. Universal Mapping Property

**Statement**  
phi is the initial object in the category of monoid homomorphisms from U to abelian groups sending units to zero. Concretely, any such psi factors uniquely through phi.

**Discussion**  
This property shows phi generates all classical multiplicative invariants (e.g., Liouville lambda, p-adic valuations, Euler's totient phi_0) by post-composition.
