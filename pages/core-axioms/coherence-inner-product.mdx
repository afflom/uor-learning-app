# Coherence Inner Product

## Formal Statement

Define `⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p)`, making the exponent space a Euclidean vector space with orthonormal prime axes.

## Deep Exploration

The Coherence Inner Product establishes a geometric framework for understanding object structure. By defining an inner product on prime coordinate vectors, it transforms the abstract space of object compositions into a rich Euclidean geometry where distances, angles, and projections all have meaningful interpretations.

This axiom gives mathematical form to the intuition that primes represent independent dimensions of structure. Each prime defines an orthogonal axis in the object space, allowing us to describe the structure of objects with the full power of Euclidean geometry. This geometric perspective reveals deep insights about how objects relate to one another based on their prime compositions.

### Key Insights

- **Geometric Structure:** Transforms prime coordinates from a purely algebraic tool into a geometric space where intuitive concepts like distance and angle apply.

- **Orthogonality of Primes:** Different primes represent truly independent aspects of structure, forming orthogonal bases in the coordinate space.

- **Similarity Measure:** The inner product provides a measure of structural similarity between objects - those with similar prime compositions have larger inner products.

### Mathematical Formalization

On the prime coordinate space `ℤ^(P)`, define the inner product `⟨·,·⟩: ℤ^(P) × ℤ^(P) → ℝ` as:

`⟨v,w⟩ = ∑_p v(p)·w(p)`

For objects `X` and `Y` with prime coordinates `φ(X)` and `φ(Y)`:

`⟨φ(X),φ(Y)⟩ = ∑_p φ(X)(p)·φ(Y)(p)`

This inner product satisfies the axioms of a Euclidean space, with the prime basis elements forming an orthonormal system.

### Connection to Other Axioms

The Coherence Inner Product extends the Coherence Norm (which is derived from it as `‖v‖ = √⟨v,v⟩`) and provides the geometric foundation for understanding the Canonical Representation axiom. It also connects to the Trilateral Coherence axiom by enabling precise descriptions of how object structure appears from different perspectives in the observer bundle.
