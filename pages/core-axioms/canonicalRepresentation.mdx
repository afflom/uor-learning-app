# Canonical Representation

## Formal Statement

The image `œÜ(X)` is a unique, lossless encoding that does not depend on numeral base or observer frame and achieves the minimal coherence norm among all representations.

## Deep Exploration

The Canonical Representation axiom establishes that an object's prime coordinate signature is its most fundamental, observer-independent description. Unlike conventional representations that may vary with base or perspective, the prime factorization provides an absolute reference that captures the intrinsic structure of any object.

This axiom addresses the profound question: "What is the most natural way to represent an object?" The answer is through its irreducible components - its prime factors. This representation is canonical in the strongest sense - it is invariant across all valid frames of reference and achieves minimal complexity.

### Key Insights

- **Base Independence:** Unlike decimal or binary expansions, prime coordinates do not depend on arbitrary choices of base or numeral system.

- **Frame Invariance:** The prime signature remains unchanged regardless of observer perspective, providing an absolute reference point.

- **Minimal Complexity:** The prime factorization achieves the lowest possible coherence norm, making it objectively the simplest representation.

- **Information Completeness:** No structural information is lost in the prime encoding; the original object can be perfectly reconstructed.

### Mathematical Formalization

For any object `X` in the universe `ùí∞`, the map `œÜ: ùí∞ ‚Üí ‚Ñ§^(P)` satisfies:

1. Injectivity: If `œÜ(X) = œÜ(Y)` then `X = Y`
2. Base invariance: `œÜ(X)` does not depend on positional notation system
3. Frame invariance: `œÜ(X)` is the same in all valid observer frames
4. Minimal coherence: `‚ÄñœÜ(X)‚Äñ` ‚â§ `‚ÄñR(X)‚Äñ` for any other representation `R`

### Connection to Other Axioms

This axiom builds on the Prime-Coordinate Homomorphism and interacts closely with the Coherence Norm, which provides the metric for measuring representational complexity. It also connects to the Trilateral Coherence axiom by ensuring that the object's intrinsic structure remains invariant across observer frames.
