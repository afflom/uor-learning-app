# Physics Interpretation

By interpreting the prime-coordinate manifold as a geometric arena, UOR recasts physical quantities in terms of coherence norms, curvatures, and fields:

- **Coherence Curvature (Gravity):** Define a connection on the observer bundle with metric induced by the coherence norm. The curvature tensor measures noncommutativity of covariant derivatives of φ. Mass distributions induce nonzero curvature, generating geodesic deviation in prime-space (gravity analogue).

- **Prime Density (Mass):** Define inertial mass as the coherence norm of an object, resisting acceleration in coherence space, and define gravitational mass via coupling term in a coherence gauge potential.

- **Spatial Extent (Volume):** For a subset of primes S, define volume as the support of φ(x) intersected with S or its Lebesgue measure under a continuous generalization, analogously measuring the spread of coherence across S.

- **Energy:** The *potential* for transforming prime exponents. Kinetic energy tracks active movement in prime space, while potential energy measures coherence tension between configurations.

- **Material:** Stable coherence patterns—distinct prime spectra—for different substances. Chemical bonds align prime exponents to minimize coherence cost.

**Outlook:** Field theories can be formulated via an action functional where discrete prime gradients are encoded. Spacetime emerges as a moduli space of observer frames, gravity as coherence curvature, and quantum states as superpositions of spectra in a Hilbert-completed prime space. This paradigm opens a path toward a prime‑space quantum gravity and coherence‑driven cosmology.
