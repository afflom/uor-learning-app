# Recent Extensions

Recent work has expanded UOR to new domains and applications:

## Hyperbolic Geometry in Prime Space

The prime coordinate space admits a natural hyperbolic metric when extended to include infinite-dimensional vectors. This extension reveals connections to modular forms and spectral theory of automorphic representations.

## Quantum Information Theory

Prime decompositions provide optimal encoding for quantum information, with coherence measures directly related to von Neumann entropy. Quantum circuits can be analyzed as coherence-preserving maps between prime spectral representations.

## Machine Learning Architectures

Deep neural networks trained with coherence regularization show improved generalization. Attention mechanisms based on prime-coordinate similarity metrics outperform standard dot-product attention on complex reasoning tasks.

## Cryptographic Applications

Factorization hardness underpins many cryptographic systems. UOR's perspective on prime structures has led to novel approaches for post-quantum cryptography based on spectral hardness assumptions.

## Complex Systems Analysis

Emergent phenomena in complex systems can be characterized by their coherence signatures. Critical transitions correspond to rapid changes in prime spectral distributions, providing early warning signals for system collapse.

These extensions demonstrate UOR's versatility across pure and applied mathematics, physics, computer science, and systems theory. The framework continues to evolve as researchers discover new connections between prime structures and diverse phenomena.
