# Beyond Integers

**Extension Theorem:** Let D be a UFD or a Dedekind domain
with unique factorization of ideals. Then φ extends to:

- **Rationals ℚ:**
  Negative exponents encode denominators.
  For example, `φ(1/3) = -φ(3)`, so
  `φ(3/4) = [(2,-2),(3,1)]`.

- **Polynomials k[x]:**
  Irreducible polynomials serve as primes; exponents represent factor multiplicity.

- **Algebraic Number Fields:** 
  In the ring of integers of a number field K, nonzero prime ideals act as primes,
  and φ maps each element to its ideal factor exponents.

- **Combinatorial domains:**
  In set unions, singletons are primes; in graph unions, connected
  components are primes.

In each domain, φ assigns a finite exponent vector
consistent with UOR's axioms. The coherence norm, spectral
interpretation, and fiber bundle formalism remain valid, showcasing
the uniform applicability of UOR across algebraic, combinatorial,
and arithmetic landscapes.
