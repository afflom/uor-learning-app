# Universal Object Reference

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework provides a comprehensive system for uniquely representing and analyzing objects across mathematical domains.

## Core Principles

UOR is built on several fundamental principles:

- Every object has a unique prime decomposition that serves as its canonical representation
- This representation is invariant across observer reference frames
- The prime-coordinate mapping creates a coherent geometric structure
- This structure reveals deep patterns in object relationships and transformations

## Framework Components

The complete UOR framework consists of several integrated components:

- **Canonical Representation:** Base-independent, observer-invariant object encoding
- **Spectral Interpretation:** Objects viewed as spectra across prime frequencies
- **Fiber Bundle Structure:** Mathematical formalism relating object structure to observer perspectives
- **Observer Coherence:** Principles ensuring consistent object description across different frames
- **Geometry of Prime Spaces:** The rich geometric structure of prime-coordinate representations
- **Algebraic & Topological Enhancements:** Advanced mathematical structures extending the basic framework
- **Category-Theoretic Perspective:** Universal properties and functorial relationships
- **Generalization:** Extensions to arbitrary domains with unique factorization

## Applications

The UOR framework has applications across mathematics and beyond:

- Unified representation system for disparate mathematical domains
- Novel geometric insights into number theory and algebra
- Framework for understanding observer-dependency in physical theories
- Foundation for information-theoretic approaches to complex systems

Through these principles and structures, UOR provides a powerful lens for understanding the intrinsic nature of mathematical objects and their relationships.
