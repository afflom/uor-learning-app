# Overview and Motivation

The Universal Object Reference (UOR) framework addresses a fundamental challenge in mathematics and physics: how to provide a canonical, observer-invariant representation for objects across diverse domains.

## The Representation Problem

Traditional representation systems face several limitations:

- Dependence on arbitrary numerical bases (binary, decimal, etc.)
- Lack of intrinsic structure-preserving properties
- Inconsistency across different mathematical domains
- Observer-dependence leading to ambiguous descriptions

UOR overcomes these limitations by providing a universal coordinate system based on prime decomposition.

## Core Insight

The central insight of UOR is that prime factorization provides a natural, intrinsic coordinate system for objects:

- Every object has a unique factorization into irreducible components
- This factorization reveals the object's inherent structure
- The prime-coordinate representation linearizes multiplicative relationships
- The resulting geometric structure unifies diverse mathematical domains

## Key Benefits

The UOR framework offers several significant advantages:

- **Universality:** Applies across number systems, polynomials, algebraic structures, and beyond
- **Invariance:** Provides representation independent of arbitrary encoding choices
- **Coherence:** Minimizes representational complexity through optimal prime decomposition
- **Integration:** Unifies structure, dynamics, and observer perspectives in a single framework

## Framework Structure

The complete UOR framework integrates several components:

1. Foundations in unique factorization domains
2. The prime-coordinate mapping system
3. Coherence metrics for measuring representational simplicity
4. Observer reference frames for perspective-aware description
5. Geometric and algebraic structures on prime-coordinate spaces

Through these elements, UOR provides a powerful new lens for understanding mathematical objects and their relationships.
