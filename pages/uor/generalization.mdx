# UOR Generalization

**Theorem (General UOR Existence):** Let D be any UFD (or GCD domain satisfying factorization axioms). Then the prime-coordinate functor φ: D^× → ℤ^P is well-defined, exact, and admits an extension to polynomial rings D[x], localizations D_S, and formal power series D[[x]], preserving unique factorization in each case.

Concretely, UOR applies whenever a domain admits a notion of irreducible generators P and a UFD-like factorization property. Key examples include:

- **Polynomial Rings D[x]:** Irreducible monic polynomials in D[x] serve as primes; φ encodes factor degrees and coefficients via multi-index valuations.

- **Combinatorial Monoids:** In incidence algebras, connected components decompose uniquely, with φ capturing component counts.

- **Localization & Sheaf Domains:** Local UFDs obtained via inverting primes (e.g. local rings at maximal ideals) carry local φ maps, gluing into sheaves over Spec(D).

In each context, φ remains injective, multiplicative-additive, and coherence‑minimizing, yielding a universal coordinate atlas. This universality hints at a grander vision: UOR as a spectrum-level invariant extending beyond first-order domains into derived categories, spectral stacks, and even the realm of homotopy types, where "primes" become indecomposable objects and φ a homotopical coordinate functor.
