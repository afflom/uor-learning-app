# Fiber Bundle Structure

**Definition (Fiber Bundle Structure):** UOR employs two nested fiber bundles to integrate object structure and observer context. A fiber bundle (E,B,œÄ,F,G) consists of a total space E, a base space B, a projection œÄ: E‚ÜíB, a typical fiber F, and a structure group G acting on F with local trivializations of E.

## Level 1: Prime Structure Bundle

- **Base:** The set of intrinsic primes P.
- **Fiber:** The valuation group ‚Ñ§ given by p-adic exponents, or ‚Ñ§‚Çä in purely integral contexts.
- **Total Space:** E‚ÇÅ, containing pairs (p,a).
- **Projection:** œÄ‚ÇÅ(p,a)=p, forgetting the exponent.
- **Section for X:** s_X(p) = (p,œÜ(X)(p)) for each prime.

## Level 2: Observer (Frame) Bundle

- **Base:** The set of all objects ùí∞.
- **Fiber:** The set R of all admissible reference frames, each encoding a choice of coordinate conventions, normalization, or grouping rules.
- **Total Space:** E‚ÇÇ = ùí∞ √ó R, pairs (X,r).
- **Projection:** œÄ‚ÇÇ(X,r)=X, forgetting the frame.
- **Canonical Frame Section:** A global section œÉ(X)=(X,r‚ÇÄ) picks the intrinsic prime frame for each object.

The canonical map Œ¶ takes each global section s_x of the prime bundle (where s_x(p)=(p,v_p(x))) to x. This reconstruction is functorial and defines an isomorphism between the section space and the monoid of objects. Both bundles are trivial in standard UOR: level‚Äë1 has no monodromy, level‚Äë2's frame bundle is globally framed by the intrinsic prime frame, implying zero curvature (all transition functions are identity).

**Curvature & Gauge Analogy:** Nontrivial frame bundles (with G‚ÇÇ non‚Äëabelian) would exhibit curvature, modeling observer transformations that do not commute‚Äîanalogous to gauge fields in principal bundles. Such enhancements lead to rich geometry and potential physical applications in quantum reference frames.

In more elaborate contexts, nontrivial frame bundles with path-dependent transition functions can model curvature or gauge-like effects, capturing how observer transformations might fail to commute and enriching the UOR geometry.
