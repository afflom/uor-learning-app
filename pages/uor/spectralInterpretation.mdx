# Spectral Interpretation

The spectral interpretation of UOR views objects through the lens of their prime frequency components, analogous to Fourier analysis in signal processing.

## Prime Frequency Domain

In this perspective:

- Each prime p corresponds to a fundamental frequency or mode
- The exponent of p in the factorization represents the amplitude of that frequency
- The prime-coordinate vector forms the complete spectrum of the object
- Composition (multiplication) becomes addition in the frequency domain

## Spectral Decomposition

Every object admits a unique spectral decomposition:

- The prime factorization corresponds to the frequency representation
- Different object classes show characteristic spectral patterns
- The complete spectrum fully determines the object's properties
- Spectral analysis reveals hidden relationships between objects

## Spectral Energy Distribution

The coherence norm measures spectral energy distribution:

- The squared norm represents the total spectral energy
- Different objects exhibit distinctive spectral energy patterns
- The principle of minimal coherence favors even distribution across frequencies
- Spectral concentration indicates special mathematical structures

## Filtering and Transformation

The spectral view enables powerful analytical operations:

- Prime filters isolate specific spectral components
- Spectral cutoffs create approximations of complex objects
- Transformations in prime-coordinate space correspond to spectral modifications
- Correlation between spectra reveals similarities between objects

This spectral interpretation provides insight into the intrinsic structure of mathematical objects, revealing patterns and relationships that might be obscured in traditional representations.
