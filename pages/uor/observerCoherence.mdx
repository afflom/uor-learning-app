# Observer Reference Frames

The UOR framework incorporates observer perspectives through the principle of trilateral coherence, ensuring that object descriptions remain consistent across different reference frames.

## Trilateral Coherence Principle

Every coherent description of an object must incorporate and harmonize three aspects:

1. **Intrinsic Structure:** The object's canonical prime decomposition
2. **Dynamical Rules:** The composition laws governing object interactions
3. **Observer Frame:** The perspective from which the object is described

These three elements form an indivisible triad - changing any one necessitates adjustments in the others to maintain a coherent description.

## Observer Frame Bundle

The mathematical formalism for observer perspectives employs a frame bundle:

- Each point in the bundle corresponds to a specific (object, observer) pair
- The projection map extracts the intrinsic object structure independent of observer
- Frame transformations allow translation between different observer perspectives
- A global section of this bundle defines a consistent choice of observer for all objects

## Frame Transformations

Transformations between observer frames must preserve certain invariants:

- The intrinsic prime decomposition remains unchanged
- The coherence metric might transform, but preserves minimality properties
- Composition laws maintain their algebraic structure across frames
- Physical quantities transform according to appropriate representation rules

## Observer-Invariant Properties

Certain properties remain invariant across all valid observer frames:

- The cardinality of the prime decomposition (number of distinct prime factors)
- The essential factorization pattern (which primes appear, if not their exact representation)
- The algebraic relationships between composed objects
- The topological features of the prime-coordinate space

Through observer coherence, UOR provides a framework for understanding how intrinsic mathematical structure relates to the perspectives from which it is observed and described.
