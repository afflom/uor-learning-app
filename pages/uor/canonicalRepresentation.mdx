# Canonical Representation

A fundamental principle of UOR is that every object has a unique, canonical representation that is independent of basis, numeral system, or observer frame.

## Base Independence

Unlike conventional number representations (binary, decimal, etc.), the prime-coordinate representation is intrinsic to the object itself:

- Not tied to any particular numeral base
- Independent of arbitrary encoding choices
- Reveals the object's inherent structure rather than human-imposed format

## Uniqueness Guarantee

The canonical representation satisfies several crucial properties:

- **Uniqueness:** Each object maps to exactly one prime-coordinate representation
- **Completeness:** All properties of the object can be recovered from its representation
- **Invariance:** The representation remains unchanged under permissible transformations

## Minimality Principle

Among all possible representations of an object, the canonical prime-coordinate form:

- Minimizes the coherence norm
- Provides the most efficient encoding (minimum description length)
- Contains no redundant information

## Frame Objectivity

While observer reference frames may interpret the representation differently, the underlying prime structure remains objective:

- Different frames observe the same intrinsic prime decomposition
- Frame transformations preserve the canonical structure
- All valid observers agree on the factorization, even with different perspectives

This canonical representation forms the foundation for UOR's ability to provide unambiguous reference across disparate domains and observer perspectives.
