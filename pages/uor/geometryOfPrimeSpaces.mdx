# Geometry of Prime Spaces

The prime-coordinate representation induces a rich geometric structure that reveals deep patterns in object composition and relationships.

## Euclidean Structure

The prime-coordinate space inherits a natural Euclidean structure from the coherence norm and inner product:

- The coherence norm ||φ(x)|| measures the intrinsic complexity of an object
- The inner product ⟨φ(x),φ(y)⟩ quantifies the degree of prime-factor similarity
- Angles between coordinate vectors represent compositional relationships
- Orthogonal objects have no common prime factors

## Lattice Geometry

Objects with integer exponents form a discrete lattice in prime-coordinate space:

- Each lattice point represents a unique factorization
- Lines through the origin correspond to powers of the same object
- Convex regions define families of objects with bounded prime exponents
- Walking along lattice paths corresponds to sequential multiplication by primes

## Spectral Interpretation

The prime-coordinate representation can be viewed as a spectral decomposition:

- Each prime contributes a "frequency" component to the object
- The exponent vector forms the object's spectrum across prime frequencies
- Composition combines spectra through vector addition
- Decomposition separates an object into its spectral components

## Metric Geometry

The coherence metric defines notions of distance and proximity between objects:

- d(x,y) = ||φ(x) - φ(y)|| measures compositional distance
- Neighborhoods contain objects with similar prime factorization
- Geodesics represent minimal paths between objects in prime-coordinate space
- Curvature appears when considering non-Euclidean coherence measures

These geometric structures provide powerful tools for analyzing patterns, relationships, and transformations across mathematical domains.
